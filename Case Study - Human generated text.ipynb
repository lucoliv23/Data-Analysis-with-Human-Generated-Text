       "[\"\\n        We investigate whether three types of post hoc model explanations--feature attribution, concept activation, and training point ranking--are effective for detecting a model's reliance on spurious signals in the training data. Specifically, we consider the scenario where the spurious signal to be detected is unknown, at test-time, to the user of the explanation method. We design an empirical methodology that uses semi-synthetic datasets along with pre-specified spurious artifacts to obtain models that verifiably rely on these spurious training signals. We then provide a suite of metrics that assess an explanation method's reliability for spurious signal detection under various conditions. We find that the post hoc explanation methods tested are ineffective when the spurious artifact is unknown at test-time especially for non-visible artifacts like a background blur. Further, we find that feature attribution methods are susceptible to erroneously indicating dependence on spurious signals even when the model being explained does not rely on spurious artifacts. This finding casts doubt on the utility of these approaches, in the hands of a practitioner, for detecting a model's reliance on spurious signals.\\n        \",\n",
       " '\\n        Our increasing reliance on digital technology for personal, economic, and government affairs has made it essential to secure the communications and devices of private citizens, businesses, and governments. This has led to pervasive use of cryptography across society. Despite its evident advantages, law enforcement and national security agencies have argued that the spread of cryptography has hindered access to evidence and intelligence. Some in industry and government now advocate a new technology to access targeted data: client-side scanning (CSS). Instead of weakening encryption or providing law enforcement with backdoor keys to decrypt communications, CSS would enable on-device analysis of data in the clear. If targeted information were detected, its existence and, potentially, its source, would be revealed to the agencies; otherwise, little or no information would leave the client device. Its proponents claim that CSS is a solution to the encryption versus public safety debate: it offers privacy -- in the sense of unimpeded end-to-end encryption -- and the ability to successfully investigate serious crime. In this report, we argue that CSS neither guarantees efficacious crime prevention nor prevents surveillance. Indeed, the effect is the opposite. CSS by its nature creates serious security and privacy risks for all society while the assistance it can provide for law enforcement is at best problematic. There are multiple ways in which client-side scanning can fail, can be evaded, and can be abused.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Fast spin-echo (FSE) pulse sequences for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offer important imaging contrast in clinically feasible scan times. T2-shuffling is widely used to resolve temporal signal dynamics in FSE acquisitions by exploiting temporal correlations via linear latent space and a predefined regularizer. However, predefined regularizers fail to exploit the incoherence especially for 2D acquisitions.Recent self-supervised learning methods achieve high-fidelity reconstructions by learning a regularizer from undersampled data without a standard supervised training data set. In this work, we propose a novel approach that utilizes a self supervised learning framework to learn a regularizer constrained on a linear latent space which improves time-resolved FSE images reconstruction quality. Additionally, in regimes without groundtruth sensitivity maps, we propose joint estimation of coil-sensitivity maps using an iterative reconstruction technique. Our technique functions is in a zero-shot fashion, as it only utilizes data from a single scan of highly undersampled time series images. We perform experiments on simulated and retrospective in-vivo data to evaluate the performance of the proposed zero-shot learning method for temporal FSE reconstruction. The results demonstrate the success of our proposed method where NMSE and SSIM are significantly increased and the artifacts are reduced.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Motion artifacts are a pervasive problem in MRI, leading to misdiagnosis or mischaracterization in population-level imaging studies. Current retrospective rigid intra-slice motion correction techniques jointly optimize estimates of the image and the motion parameters. In this paper, we use a deep network to reduce the joint image-motion parameter search to a search over rigid motion parameters alone. Our network produces a reconstruction as a function of two inputs: corrupted k-space data and motion parameters. We train the network using simulated, motion-corrupted k-space data generated from known motion parameters. At test-time, we estimate unknown motion parameters by minimizing a data consistency loss between the motion parameters, the network-based image reconstruction given those parameters, and the acquired measurements. Intra-slice motion correction experiments on simulated and realistic 2D fast spin echo brain MRI achieve high reconstruction fidelity while retaining the benefits of explicit data consistency-based optimization. Our code is publicly available at https://www.github.com/nalinimsingh/neuroMoCo.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Purpose: Training auto-encoders on simulated signal evolution and inserting the decoder into the forward model improves reconstructions through more compact, Bloch-equation-based representations of signal in comparison to linear subspaces.\\n  Methods: Building on model-based nonlinear and linear subspace techniques that enable reconstruction of signal dynamics, we train auto-encoders on dictionaries of simulated signal evolution to learn more compact, non-linear, latent representations. The proposed Latent Signal Model framework inserts the decoder portion of the auto-encoder into the forward model and directly reconstructs the latent representation. Latent Signal Models essentially serve as a proxy for fast and feasible differentiation through the Bloch-equations used to simulate signal. This work performs experiments in the context of T2-shuffling, gradient echo EPTI, and MPRAGE-shuffling. We compare how efficiently auto-encoders represent signal evolution in comparison to linear subspaces. Simulation and in-vivo experiments then evaluate if reducing degrees of freedom by inserting the decoder into the forward model improves reconstructions in comparison to subspace constraints.\\n  Results: An auto-encoder with one real latent variable represents FSE, EPTI, and MPRAGE signal evolution as well as linear subspaces characterized by four basis vectors. In simulated/in-vivo T2-shuffling and in-vivo EPTI experiments, the proposed framework achieves consistent quantitative NRMSE and qualitative improvement over linear approaches. From qualitative evaluation, the proposed approach yields images with reduced blurring and noise amplification in MPRAGE shuffling experiments.\\n  Conclusion: Directly solving for non-linear latent representations of signal evolution improves time-resolved MRI reconstructions through reduced degrees of freedom.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Volumetric reconstruction of fetal brains from multiple stacks of MR slices, acquired in the presence of almost unpredictable and often severe subject motion, is a challenging task that is highly sensitive to the initialization of slice-to-volume transformations. We propose a novel slice-to-volume registration method using Transformers trained on synthetically transformed data, which model multiple stacks of MR slices as a sequence. With the attention mechanism, our model automatically detects the relevance between slices and predicts the transformation of one slice using information from other slices. We also estimate the underlying 3D volume to assist slice-to-volume registration and update the volume and transformations alternately to improve accuracy. Results on synthetic data show that our method achieves lower registration error and better reconstruction quality compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. Experiments with real-world MRI data are also performed to demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to improve the quality of 3D reconstruction under severe fetal motion.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Image corruption by motion artifacts is an ingrained problem in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In this work, we propose a neural network-based regularization term to enhance Autofocusing, a classic optimization-based method to remove motion artifacts. The method takes the best of both worlds: the optimization-based routine iteratively executes the blind demotion and deep learning-based prior penalizes for unrealistic restorations and speeds up the convergence. We validate the method on three models of motion trajectories, using synthetic and real noisy data. The method proves resilient to noise and anatomic structure variation, outperforming the state-of-the-art demotion methods.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        In fetal-brain MRI, head-pose changes between prescription and acquisition present a challenge to obtaining the standard sagittal, coronal and axial views essential to clinical assessment. As motion limits acquisitions to thick slices that preclude retrospective resampling, technologists repeat ~55-second stack-of-slices scans (HASTE) with incrementally reoriented field of view numerous times, deducing the head pose from previous stacks. To address this inefficient workflow, we propose a robust head-pose detection algorithm using full-uterus scout scans (EPI) which take ~5 seconds to acquire.

       " '\\n        Fetal motion is unpredictable and rapid on the scale of conventional MR scan times. Therefore, dynamic fetal MRI, which aims at capturing fetal motion and dynamics of fetal function, is limited to fast imaging techniques with compromises in image quality and resolution. Super-resolution for dynamic fetal MRI is still a challenge, especially when multi-oriented stacks of image slices for oversampling are not available and high temporal resolution for recording the dynamics of the fetus or placenta is desired. Further, fetal motion makes it difficult to acquire high-resolution images for supervised learning methods. To address this problem, in this work, we propose STRESS (Spatio-Temporal Resolution Enhancement with Simulated Scans), a self-supervised super-resolution framework for dynamic fetal MRI with interleaved slice acquisitions. Our proposed method simulates an interleaved slice acquisition along the high-resolution axis on the originally acquired data to generate pairs of low- and high-resolution images. Then, it trains a super-resolution network by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations in the MR time series, which is used to enhance the resolution of the original data. Evaluations on both simulated and in utero data show that our proposed method outperforms other self-supervised super-resolution methods and improves image quality, which is beneficial to other downstream tasks and evaluations.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Image denoising is of great importance for medical imaging system, since it can improve image quality for disease diagnosis and downstream image analyses. In a variety of applications, dynamic imaging techniques are utilized to capture the time-varying features of the subject, where multiple images are acquired for the same subject at different time points. Although signal-to-noise ratio of each time frame is usually limited by the short acquisition time, the correlation among different time frames can be exploited to improve denoising results with shared information across time frames. With the success of neural networks in computer vision, supervised deep learning methods show prominent performance in single-image denoising, which rely on large datasets with clean-vs-noisy image pairs. Recently, several self-supervised deep denoising models have been proposed, achieving promising results without needing the pairwise ground truth of clean images. In the field of multi-image denoising, however, very few works have been done on extracting correlated information from multiple slices for denoising using self-supervised deep learning methods. In this work, we propose Deformed2Self, an end-to-end self-supervised deep learning framework for dynamic imaging denoising. It combines single-image and multi-image denoising to improve image quality and use a spatial transformer network to model motion between different slices. Further, it only requires a single noisy image with a few auxiliary observations at different time frames for training and inference. Evaluations on phantom and in vivo data with different noise statistics show that our method has comparable performance to other state-of-the-art unsupervised or self-supervised denoising methods and outperforms under high noise levels.\\n        ',\n",

Current mitigation of motion artifacts is predominantly performed by fast, single-shot MRI and retrospective motion correction. Estimation of fetal pose in real time during MRI stands to benefit prospective methods to detect and mitigate fetal motion artifacts where inferred fetal motion is combined with online slice prescription with low-latency decision making. Current developments of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), offer a novel approach for fetal landmarks detection. In this task 15 agents are deployed to detect 15 landmarks simultaneously by DRL. The optimization is challenging, and here we propose an improved DRL that incorporates priors on physical structure of the fetal body. First, we use graph communication layers to improve the communication among agents based on a graph where each node represents a fetal-body landmark. Further, additional reward based on the distance between agents and physical structures such as the fetal limbs is used to fully exploit physical structure. Evaluation of this method on a repository of 3-mm resolution in vivo data demonstrates a mean accuracy of landmark estimation within 10 mm of ground truth as 87.3%, and a mean error of 6.9 mm. The proposed DRL for fetal pose landmark search demonstrates a potential clinical utility for online detection of fetal motion that guides real-time mitigation of motion artifacts as well as health diagnosis during MRI of the pregnant mother.\\n        ',\n",

Our work is motivated by the challenges arising in MRI acquisition where the signal is a corrupted Fourier transform of the desired image. The proposed joint learning schemes enable both correction of artifacts native to the frequency space and manipulation of image space representations to reconstruct coherent image structures at every layer of the network. This is in contrast to most current deep learning approaches for image reconstruction that treat frequency and image space features separately and often operate exclusively in one of the two spaces. We demonstrate the advantages of joint convolutional learning for a variety of tasks, including motion correction, denoising, reconstruction from undersampled acquisitions, and combined undersampling and motion correction on simulated and real world multicoil MRI data. The joint models produce consistently high quality output images across all tasks and datasets. When integrated into a state of the art unrolled optimization network with physics-inspired data consistency constraints for undersampled reconstruction, the proposed architectures significantly improve the optimization landscape, which yields an order of magnitude reduction of training time. This result suggests that joint representations are particularly well suited for MRI signals in deep learning networks.

The current protocol for T2-weighted fetal brain MRI is not robust to motion so image volumes are degraded by inter- and intra- slice motion artifacts. Besides, manual annotation for fetal MR image quality assessment are usually time-consuming. Therefore, in this work, a semi-supervised deep learning method that detects slices with artifacts during the brain volume scan is proposed. Our method is based on the mean teacher model, where we not only enforce consistency between student and teacher models on the whole image, but also adopt an ROI consistency loss to guide the network to focus on the brain region. The proposed method is evaluated on a fetal brain MR dataset with 11,223 labeled images and more than 200,000 unlabeled images. Results show that compared with supervised learning, the proposed method can improve model accuracy by about 6\\\\% and outperform other state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods.

Complementary k-space sampling across imaging contrasts and Bunch-Phase/Wave-Encoding were used for data acquisition to improve the reconstruction at high accelerations. At 3T, our joint variational network approach across T1w, T2w and T2-FLAIR-weighted brain scans was tested for retrospective under-sampling at R=6 (2D) and R=4x4 (3D) acceleration. Prospective acceleration was also performed for 3D data where the combined acquisition time for whole brain coverage at 1 mm isotropic resolution across three contrasts was less than three minutes.\\n  Results: Across all test datasets, our joint multi-contrast network better preserved fine anatomical details with reduced image-blurring when compared to the corresponding single-contrast reconstructions. Improvement in image quality was also obtained through complementary k-space sampling and Bunch-Phase/Wave-Encoding where the synergistic combination yielded the overall best performance as evidenced by exemplarily slices and quantitative error metrics.\\n  Conclusion: By leveraging shared anatomical structures across the jointly reconstructed scans, our joint multi-contrast approach learnt more efficient regularizers which helped to retain natural image appearance and avoid over-smoothing. When synergistically combined with advanced encoding techniques, the performance was further improved, enabling up to R=16-fold acceleration with good image quality.

NDI is flexible enough to allow for reconstruction from an arbitrary number of head orientations, and outperforms COSMOS even when using as few as 1-direction data. This is made possible by a nonlinear forward-model that uses the magnitude as an effective prior, for which we derived a simple gradient descent update rule. We synergistically combine this physics-model with a Variational Network (VN) to leverage the power of deep learning in the VaNDI algorithm. This technique adopts the simple gradient descent rule from NDI and learns the network parameters during training, hence requires no additional parameter tuning. Further, we evaluate NDI at 7T using highly accelerated Wave-CAIPI acquisitions at 0.5 mm isotropic resolution and demonstrate high-quality QSM from as few as 2-direction data.\\n        ',\n",

Surprisingly little is known about the characteristics of fetal motion during MRI and here we propose and demonstrate methods that exploit a growing repository of MRI observations of the gravid abdomen that are acquired at low spatial resolution but relatively high temporal resolution and over long durations (10-30 minutes). We estimate fetal pose per frame in MRI volumes of the pregnant abdomen via deep learning algorithms that detect key fetal landmarks. Evaluation of the proposed method shows that our framework achieves quantitatively an average error of 4.47 mm and 96.4\\\\% accuracy (with error less than 10 mm). Fetal pose estimation in MRI time series yields novel means of quantifying fetal movements in health and disease, and enables the learning of kinematic models that may enhance prospective mitigation of fetal motion artifacts during MRI acquisition.\\n        ',\n",

Current registration methods often fail when aligning images that are substantially different from a template (reference image). To achieve accurate and robust alignment, we make a Markov assumption on the nature of motion and take advantage of the temporal smoothness in the image data. Forward message passing in the corresponding hidden Markov model (HMM) yields an estimation algorithm that only has to account for relatively small motion between consecutive frames.

We suggest that TinyML, ML on resource-constrained embedded devices, is an attractive means to widen access because TinyML both leverages low-cost and globally accessible hardware, and encourages the development of complete, self-contained applications, from data collection to deployment. To this end, a collaboration between academia (Harvard University) and industry (Google) produced a four-part MOOC that provides application-oriented instruction on how to develop solutions using TinyML.

It introduces pupils to real-world applications, ML algorithms, data-set engineering, and the ethical considerations of these technologies via hands-on programming and deployment of TinyML applications in both the cloud and their own microcontrollers. To facilitate continued learning, community building, and collaboration beyond the courses, we launched a standalone website, a forum, a chat, and an optional course-project competition.

The challenges of contact planning include determining not only the sequence by which contact is made and broken between the locomotor and the environments, but also the sequence of internal shape changes (e.g., body bending and limb shoulder joint oscillation). Most state-of-art contact planning algorithms focused on conventional robots (e.g.biped and quadruped) and conventional tasks (e.g. forward locomotion), and there is a lack of study on general contact planning in multi-legged robots. In this paper, we show that using geometric mechanics framework, we can obtain the global optimal contact sequence given the internal shape changes sequence. Therefore, we simplify the contact planning problem to a graph optimization problem to identify the internal shape changes. Taking advantages of the spatio-temporal symmetry in locomotion, we map the graph optimization problem to special cases of spin models, which allows us to obtain the global optima in polynomial time.

To our surprise, we find that our formulation leads to policies that can outperform existing offline RL approaches across standard benchmarks. By modeling a policy as a return-conditional diffusion model, we illustrate how we may circumvent the need for dynamic programming and subsequently eliminate many of the complexities that come with traditional offline RL. We further demonstrate the advantages of modeling policies as conditional diffusion models by considering two other conditioning variables: constraints and skills.

To address this, we propose a reward learning approach, Graph-based Equivalence Mappings (GEM), that can discover spatial goal representations that are aligned with the intended goal specification, enabling successful generalization in unseen environments. Specifically, GEM represents a spatial goal specification by a reward function conditioned on i) a graph indicating important spatial relationships between objects and ii) state equivalence mappings for each edge in the graph indicating invariant properties of the corresponding relationship. GEM combines inverse reinforcement learning and active reward learning to efficiently improve the reward function by utilizing the graph structure and domain randomization enabled by the equivalence mappings.

We overcome these limitations and present a general object reorientation controller that is trained using reinforcement learning in simulation and evaluated in the real world. Our system uses readings from a single commodity depth camera to dynamically reorient complex objects by any amount in real time. The controller generalizes to novel objects not used during training.

To address the challenge of exploration, prior works incentivize exploration by rewarding the agent when it visits novel states. Such intrinsic rewards (also called exploration bonus or curiosity) often lead to excellent performance on hard exploration tasks. However, on easy exploration tasks, the agent gets distracted by intrinsic rewards and performs unnecessary exploration even when sufficient task (also called extrinsic) reward is available. Consequently, such an overly curious agent performs worse than an agent trained with only task reward. Such inconsistency in performance across tasks prevents the widespread use of intrinsic rewards with RL algorithms. We propose a principled constrained optimization procedure called Extrinsic-Intrinsic Policy Optimization (EIPO) that automatically tunes the importance of the intrinsic reward: it suppresses the intrinsic reward when exploration is unnecessary and increases it when exploration is required. The results is superior exploration that does not require manual tuning in balancing the intrinsic reward against the task reward.

The most common way to approach this challenge is to employ pessimistic or conservative methods, which avoid behaviors that are too dissimilar from those in the training dataset. However, relying exclusively on conservatism has drawbacks: performance is sensitive to the exact degree of conservatism, and conservative objectives can recover highly suboptimal policies. In this work, we propose that offline RL methods should instead be adaptive in the presence of uncertainty. We show that acting optimally in offline RL in a Bayesian sense involves solving an implicit POMDP. As a result, optimal policies for offline RL must be adaptive, depending not just on the current state but rather all the transitions seen so far during evaluation.We present a model-free algorithm for approximating this optimal adaptive policy, and demonstrate the efficacy of learning such adaptive policies in offline RL benchmarks.\\n        ',\n",

Training such an end-to-end system allows representations that are useful for downstream tasks to emerge automatically. However, the lack of inductive bias makes this system data-hungry. We hypothesize a sufficient representation of the current view and the goal view for a navigation policy can be learned by predicting the location and size of a crop of the current view that corresponds to the goal. We further show that training such random crop prediction in a self-supervised fashion purely on synthetic noise images transfers well to natural home images. The learned representation can then be bootstrapped to learn a navigation policy efficiently with little interaction data.

While multi-layer perceptron networks are universal function approximators, recent works in neural kernel regression suggest the presence of a spectral bias, where fitting high-frequency components of the value function requires exponentially more gradient update steps than the low-frequency ones. In this work, we re-examine off-policy reinforcement learning through the lens of kernel regression and propose to overcome such bias via a composite neural tangent kernel. With just a single line-change, our approach, the Fourier feature networks (FFN) produce state-of-the-art performance on challenging continuous control domains with only a fraction of the compute. Faster convergence and better off-policy stability also make it possible to remove the target network without suffering catastrophic divergences, which further reduces TD}(0)'s estimation bias on a few tasks.\\n        \",\n",

When learning to achieve multiple goals, data efficiency is intimately connected with the generalization of the Q-function to new goals. The de-facto paradigm is to approximate Q(s, a, g) using monolithic neural networks. To improve the generalization of the Q-function, we propose a bilinear decomposition that represents the Q-value via a low-rank approximation in the form of a dot product between two vector fields. The first vector field, f(s, a), captures the environment's local dynamics at the state s; whereas the second component, œÜ(s, g), captures the global relationship between the current state and the goal.

During this process, engineers often spend their time redesigning or reshaping components as they discover better topologies for the robotic manipulator. Tactile sensors, while useful, often complicate the design due to their bulky form factor. We propose an integrated design pipeline to streamline the design and manufacturing of robotic manipulators with knitted, glove-like tactile sensors. The proposed pipeline allows a designer to assemble a collection of modular, open-source components by applying predefined graph grammar rules. The end result is an intuitive design paradigm that allows the creation of new virtual designs of manipulators in a matter of minutes. Our framework allows the designer to fine-tune the manipulator's shape through cage-based geometry deformation. Finally, the designer can select surfaces for adding tactile sensing. Once the manipulator design is finished, the program will automatically generate 3D printing and knitting files for manufacturing.

This strategy often uniformly and randomly samples or prioritizes data sampling based on measures such as the temporal difference (TD) error. Such sampling strategies can be inefficient at learning Q-function because a state's Q-value depends on the Q-value of successor states. If the data sampling strategy ignores the precision of the Q-value estimate of the next state, it can lead to useless and often incorrect updates to the Q-values. To mitigate this issue, we organize the agent's experience into a graph that explicitly tracks the dependency between Q-values of states. Each edge in the graph represents a transition between two states by executing a single action. We perform value backups via a breadth-first search starting from that expands vertices in the graph starting from the set of terminal states and successively moving backward.

We make three contributions to mitigate these issues: (i) First, we show that existing map-based methods fail to effectively use semantic clues for exploration. We present a semantic-agnostic exploration strategy (called Stubborn) without any learning that surprisingly outperforms prior work.

We employ this representation for object manipulation, where given a task demonstration, we want to repeat the same task on a new object instance from the same category. We propose to achieve this objective by searching (via optimization) for the pose whose descriptor matches that observed in the demonstration. NDFs are conveniently trained in a self-supervised fashion via a 3D auto-encoding task that does not rely on expert-labeled keypoints. Further, NDFs are SE(3)-equivariant, guaranteeing performance that generalizes across all possible 3D object translations and rotations. We demonstrate learning of manipulation tasks from few (5-10) demonstrations both in simulation and on a real robot.

Here, we show that rather than using only invariance, pre-training that encourages non-trivial equivariance to some transformations, while maintaining invariance to other transformations, can be used to improve the semantic quality of representations. Specifically, we extend popular SSL methods to a more general framework which we name Equivariant Self-Supervised Learning (E-SSL). In E-SSL, a simple additional pre-training objective encourages equivariance by predicting the transformations applied to the input. We demonstrate E-SSL's effectiveness empirically on several popular computer vision benchmarks, e.g. improving SimCLR to 72.5% linear probe accuracy on ImageNet. Furthermore, we demonstrate usefulness of E-SSL for applications beyond computer vision; in particular, we show its utility on regression problems in photonics science.

The primary reason is the trade-off between the complexity of designs that is necessary for contact-rich tasks against the practical constraints of manufacturing, optimization, contact handling, etc. We overcome several of these challenges by building an end-to-end differentiable framework for contact-aware robot design. The two key components of this framework are: a novel deformation-based parameterization that allows for the design of articulated rigid robots with arbitrary, complex geometry, and a differentiable rigid body simulator that can handle contact-rich scenarios and computes analytical gradients for a full spectrum of kinematic and dynamic parameters.

We conjecture that this bias exists because the volume of functions that maps to low effective rank embedding increases with depth. We show empirically that our claim holds true on finite width linear and non-linear models on practical learning paradigms and show that on natural data, these are often the solutions that generalize well. We then show that the simplicity bias exists at both initialization and after training and is resilient to hyper-parameters and learning methods.

However, in many practical applications, the situation is reversed: an agent may have access to large amounts of undirected offline experience data, while access to the online environment is severely limited. In this work, we focus on this offline setting. Our main insight is that, when presented with offline data composed of a variety of behaviors, an effective way to leverage this data is to extract a continuous space of recurring and temporally extended primitive behaviors before using these primitives for downstream task learning. Primitives extracted in this way serve two purposes: they delineate the behaviors that are supported by the data from those that are not, making them useful for avoiding distributional shift in offline RL; and they provide a degree of temporal abstraction, which reduces the effective horizon yielding better learning in theory, and improved offline RL in practice. In addition to benefiting offline policy optimization, we show that performing offline primitive learning in this way can also be leveraged for improving few-shot imitation learning as well as exploration and transfer in online RL on a variety of benchmark domains.

Our models directly process raw visual input, and use a novel object-centric prediction formulation based on visual glimpses centered on objects (fixations) to enforce translational invariance of the learned physical laws. The agent gathers training data through random interaction with a collection of different environments, and the resulting model can then be used to plan goal-directed actions in novel environments that the agent has not seen before. We demonstrate that our agent can accurately plan actions for playing a simulated billiards game, which requires pushing a ball into a target position or into collision with another ball.\\n        ',\n",

Feedforward architectures can learn rich representations of the input space but do not explicitly model dependencies in the output spaces, that are quite structured for tasks such as articulated human pose estimation or object segmentation. Here we propose a framework that expands the expressive power of hierarchical feature extractors to encompass both input and output spaces, by introducing top-down feedback. Instead of directly predicting the outputs in one go, we use a self-correcting model that progressively changes an initial solution by feeding back error predictions, in a process we call Iterative Error Feedback (IEF). IEF shows excellent performance on the task of articulated pose estimation in the challenging MPII and LSP benchmarks, matching the state-of-the-art without requiring ground truth scale annotation.\\n        ',\n",

Is it possible to learn useful features for a diverse set of visual tasks using any other form of supervision? In biology, living organisms developed the ability of visual perception for the purpose of moving and acting in the world. Drawing inspiration from this observation, in this work we investigate if the awareness of egomotion can be used as a supervisory signal for feature learning. As opposed to the knowledge of class labels, information about egomotion is freely available to mobile agents. We show that given the same number of training images, features learnt using egomotion as supervision compare favourably to features learnt using class-label as supervision on visual tasks of scene recognition, object recognition, visual odometry and keypoint matching.\\n        ',\n",

Over the past few years neuroscientists have made remarkable progress in understanding how the human brain represents categories of objects and actions in natural scenes. However, all current models of high-level human vision operate on hand annotated images in which the objects and actions have been assigned semantic tags by a human operator. No current models can account for high-level visual function directly in terms of low-level visual input (i.e., pixels). To overcome this fundamental limitation we sought to develop a new class of models that can predict human brain activity directly from low-level visual input (i.e., pixels). We explored two classes of models drawn from computer vision and machine learning. The first class of models was based on Fisher Vectors (FV) and the second was based on Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). We find that both classes of models accurately predict brain activity in high-level visual areas, directly from pixels and without the need for any semantic tags or hand annotation of images. This is the first time that such a mapping has been obtained. The fit models provide a new platform for exploring the functional principles of human vision, and they show that modern methods of computer vision and machine learning provide important tools for characterizing brain function.\\n        ',\n",

Prior approaches to mitigate this issue assume task labels (which are often not available in practice) or use off-policy methods that can suffer from instability and poor performance.\\n  We present Locally Constrained Policy Optimization (LCPO), an on-policy RL approach that combats CF by anchoring policy outputs on old experiences while optimizing the return on current experiences. To perform this anchoring, LCPO locally constrains policy optimization using samples from experiences that lie outside of the current input distribution. We evaluate LCPO in two gym and computer systems environments with a variety of synthetic and real input traces, and find that it outperforms state-of-the-art on-policy and off-policy RL methods in the online setting, while achieving results on-par with an offline agent pre-trained on the whole input trace.\\n        ',\n",

Neither classical nor learning-based methods yield satisfactory performance when estimating the cardinality of the join queries. They either rely on simplified assumptions leading to ineffective cardinality estimates or build large models to understand the data distributions, leading to long planning times and a lack of generalizability across queries.\\n  In this paper, we propose a new framework FactorJoin for estimating join queries. FactorJoin combines the idea behind the classical join-histogram method to efficiently handle joins with the learning-based methods to accurately capture attribute correlation. Specifically, FactorJoin scans every table in a DB and builds single-table conditional distributions during an offline preparation phase. When a join query comes, FactorJoin translates it into a factor graph model over the learned distributions to effectively and efficiently estimate its cardinality.\\n  Unlike existing learning-based methods, FactorJoin does not need to de-normalize joins upfront or require executed query workloads to train the model. Since it only relies on single-table statistics, FactorJoin has small space overhead and is extremely easy to train and maintain. In our evaluation, FactorJoin can produce more effective estimates than the previous state-of-the-art learning-based methods, with 40x less estimation latency, 100x smaller model size, and 100x faster training speed at comparable or better accuracy. In addition, FactorJoin can estimate 10,000 sub-plan queries within one second to optimize the query plan, which is very close to the traditional cardinality estimators in commercial DBMS.\\n        ',\n",

Recently, several neural alternatives have been proposed that reconstruct talking head videos at very low bitrates using sparse representations of each frame such as facial landmark information. However, these approaches produce poor reconstructions in scenarios with major movement or occlusions over the course of a call, and do not scale to higher resolutions. We design Gemino, a new neural compression system for video conferencing based on a novel high-frequency-conditional super-resolution pipeline. Gemino upsamples a very low-resolution version of each target frame while enhancing high-frequency details (e.g., skin texture, hair, etc.) based on information extracted from a single high-resolution reference image. We use a multi-scale architecture that runs different components of the model at different resolutions, allowing it to scale to resolutions comparable to 720p, and we personalize the model to learn specific details of each person, achieving much better fidelity at low bitrates. We implement Gemino atop aiortc, an open-source Python implementation of WebRTC, and show that it operates on 1024x1024 videos in real-time on a A100 GPU, and achieves 2.9x lower bitrate than traditional video codecs for the same perceptual quality.\\n        ',\n",

Existing schemes coordinate transmissions across peers to avoid sending redundant data, but they either incur a high latency or are not robust against adversarial network nodes. We present Strokkur, a new transaction broadcasting mechanism that provides both low bandwidth overhead and low latency. The core idea behind Strokkur is to avoid explicit coordination through randomized transaction coding. Rather than forward individual transactions. Strokkur nodes send out codewords -- XOR sums of multiple transactions selected at random. Since almost every codeword is useful for the receiver to decode new transactions, Strokkur nodes do not require coordination, for example, to determine which transactions the receiver is missing. Strokkur's coding strategy builds on LT codes, a popular class of rateless erasure codes, and extends them to support multiple uncoordinated senders with partially-overlapping continual streams of transaction data. Strokkur introduces mechanisms to cope with adversarial senders that may send corrupt codewords, and a simple rate control algorithm that enables each node to independently determine an appropriate sending rate of codewords for each peer. Our implementation of Strokkur in Golang supports 647k transactions per second using only one CPU core. Our evaluation across a 19-node Internet deployment and large-scale simulation show that Strokkur consumes 2--7.6x less bandwidth than the existing scheme in Bitcoin, and 9x lower latency that Shrec when only 4% of nodes are adversarial.\\n        \",\n",

Network tail latency is often a crucial metric for cloud application performance that can be affected by a wide variety of factors, including network load, inter-rack traffic skew, traffic burstiness, flow size distributions, oversubscription, and topology asymmetry. Network simulators such as ns-3 and OMNeT++ can provide accurate answers, but are very hard to parallelize, taking hours or days to answer what if questions for a single configuration at even moderate scale. Recent work with MimicNet has shown how to use machine learning to improve simulation performance, but at a cost of including a long training step per configuration, and with assumptions about workload and topology uniformity that typically do not hold in practice.\\n  We address this gap by developing a set of techniques to provide fast performance estimates for large scale networks with general traffic matrices and topologies. A key step is to decompose the problem into a large number of parallel independent single-link simulations; we carefully combine these link-level simulations to produce accurate estimates of end-to-end flow level performance distributions for the entire network. Like MimicNet, we exploit symmetry where possible to gain additional speedups, but without relying on machine learning, so there is no training delay. On large-scale networks where ns-3 takes 11 to 27 hours to simulate five seconds of network behavior, our techniques run in one to two minutes with 99th percentile accuracy within 9% for flow completion times.\\n        ',\n",

Cellular network bandwidth inherently varies with receiver motion and orientation, while class-based packet scheduling in datacenter and service provider networks induces high variability in available capacity for network tenants. Recent work has proposed numerous congestion control protocols to cope with this variability, offering different tradeoffs between link utilization and queuing delay. In this paper, we develop a formal model of congestion control over time-varying links, and we use this model to derive a bound on the performance of any congestion control protocol running over a time-varying link with a given distribution of rate variation. Using the insights from this analysis, we derive an optimal control law that offers a smooth tradeoff between link utilization and queuing delay. We compare the performance of this control law to several existing control algorithms on cellular link traces to show that there is significant room for optimization.\\n        ',\n",

RL can learn good policies without the need for modeling the environment's dynamics. Despite this promise, RL remains an impractical solution for many real-world systems problems. A particularly challenging case occurs when the environment changes over time, i.e. it exhibits non-stationarity. In this work, we characterize the challenges introduced by non-stationarity, shed light on the range of approaches to them and develop a robust framework for addressing them to train RL agents in live systems. Such agents must explore and learn new environments, without hurting the system's performance, and remember them over time. To this end, our framework (i) identifies different environments encountered by the live system, (ii) triggers exploration when necessary, (iii) takes precautions to retain knowledge from prior environments, and (iv) employs safeguards to protect the system's performance when the RL agent makes mistakes. We apply our framework to two systems problems, straggler mitigation and adaptive video streaming, and evaluate it against a variety of alternative approaches using real-world and synthetic data. We show that all components of the framework are necessary to cope with non-stationarity and provide guidance on alternative design choices for each component.\\n        \",\n",

Current trace-driven simulators assume that the interventions being simulated (e.g., a new algorithm) would not affect the validity of the traces. However, real-world traces are often biased by the choices of algorithms made during trace collection, and hence replaying traces under an intervention may lead to incorrect results. CausalSim addresses this challenge by learning a causal model of the system dynamics and latent factors capturing the underlying system conditions during trace collection. It learns these models using an initial randomized control trial (RCT) under a fixed set of algorithms, and then applies them to remove biases from trace data when simulating new algorithms.\\n  Key to CausalSim is mapping unbiased trace-driven simulation to a tensor completion problem with extremely sparse observations. By exploiting a basic distributional invariance property present in RCT data, CausalSim enables a novel tensor completion method despite the sparsity of observations. Our extensive evaluation of CausalSim on both real and synthetic datasets, including more than ten months of real data from the Puffer video streaming system show it improves simulation accuracy, reducing errors by 53% and 61% on average compared to expert-designed and supervised learning baselines. Moreover, CausalSim provides markedly different insights about ABR algorithms compared to the biased baseline simulator, which we validate with a real deployment.\\n        ',\n",

In this paper, we consider the case where future increases in cluster size will cause the global batch size that can be used to train models to reach a fundamental limit: beyond a certain point, larger global batch sizes cause sample efficiency to degrade, increasing overall time to accuracy. As a result, to achieve further improvements in training performance, we must instead consider \"strong scaling\" strategies that hold the global batch size constant and allocate smaller batches to each GPU. Unfortunately, this makes it significantly more difficult to use cluster resources efficiently. We present DeepPool, a system that addresses this efficiency challenge through two key ideas. First, burst parallelism allocates large numbers of GPUs to foreground jobs in bursts to exploit the unevenness in parallelism across layers. Second, GPU multiplexing prioritizes throughput for foreground training jobs, while packing in background training jobs to reclaim underutilized GPU resources, thereby improving cluster-wide utilization. Together, these two ideas enable DeepPool to deliver a 1.2 - 2.3x improvement in total cluster throughput over standard data parallelism with a single task when the cluster scale is large.\\n        ',\n",

They cause congestion and excessive message delays in a real network due to its bandwidth constraints. In contrast, longest chain (LC), an important family of consensus protocols, has previously only been proven secure assuming an idealized network model in which all messages are delivered within bounded delay. This model-reality mismatch is further aggravated for Proof-of-Stake (PoS) LC where the adversary can spam the network with equivocating blocks. Hence, we extend the network model to capture bandwidth constraints, under which nodes now need to choose carefully which blocks to spend their limited download budget on. To illustrate this point, we show that 'download along the longest header chain', a natural download rule for Proof-of-Work (PoW) LC, is insecure for PoS LC. We propose a simple rule 'download towards the freshest block', formalize two common heuristics 'not downloading equivocations' and 'blocklisting', and prove in a unified framework that PoS LC with any one of these download rules is secure in bandwidth-constrained networks. In experiments, we validate our claims and showcase the behavior of these download rules under attack. By composing multiple instances of a PoS LC protocol with a suitable download rule in parallel, we obtain a PoS consensus protocol that achieves a constant fraction of the network's throughput limit even under worst-case adversarial strategies.\\n        \",\n",

To address this challenge, much work has studied automatically processing geospatial data sources such as GPS trajectories and satellite images to reduce the cost of maintaining digital maps. An end-to-end map update system would first process geospatial data sources to extract insights, and second leverage those insights to update and improve the map. However, prior work largely focuses on the first step of this pipeline: these map extraction methods infer road networks from scratch given geospatial data sources (in effect creating entirely new maps), but do not address the second step of leveraging this extracted information to update the existing digital map data. In this paper, we first explain why current map extraction techniques yield low accuracy when extended to update existing maps. We then propose a novel method that leverages the progression of satellite imagery over time to substantially improve accuracy. Our approach first compares satellite images captured at different times to identify portions of the physical road network that have visibly changed, and then updates the existing map accordingly. We show that our change-based approach reduces map update error rates four-fold.\\n        ',\n",

The core idea of DispersedLedger is to enable nodes to propose, order, and agree on blocks of transactions without having to download their full content. By enabling nodes to agree on an ordered log of blocks, with a guarantee that each block is available within the network and unmalleable, DispersedLedger decouples bandwidth-intensive block downloads at different nodes, allowing each to make progress at its own pace. We build a full system prototype and evaluate it on real-world and emulated networks. Our results on a geo-distributed wide-area deployment across the Internet shows that DispersedLedger achieves 2x better throughput and 74% reduction in latency compared to HoneyBadger, the state-of-the-art asynchronous protocol.\\n        ',\n",

This paper presents a new approach that augments existing codecs with a small, content-adaptive super-resolution model that significantly boosts video quality. Our method, SRVC, encodes video into two bitstreams: (i) a content stream, produced by compressing downsampled low-resolution video with the existing codec, (ii) a model stream, which encodes periodic updates to a lightweight super-resolution neural network customized for short segments of the video. SRVC decodes the video by passing the decompressed low-resolution video frames through the (time-varying) super-resolution model to reconstruct high-resolution video frames.

Credit networks arise naturally in many financial systems, including the recent construct of payment channel networks in blockchain systems. An important performance metric for these networks is their transaction throughput. However, predicting the throughput of a credit network is nontrivial. Unlike traditional communication channels, credit channels can become imbalanced; they are unable to support more transactions in a given direction once the credit limit has been reached. This potential for imbalance creates a complex dependency between a network's throughput and its topology, path choices, and the credit balances (state) on every channel. Even worse, certain combinations of these factors can lead the credit network to deadlocked states where no transactions can make progress. In this paper, we study the relationship between the throughput of a credit network and its topology and credit state. We show that the presence of deadlocks completely characterizes a network's throughput sensitivity to different credit states. Although we show that identifying deadlocks in an arbitrary topology is NP-hard, we propose a peeling algorithm inspired by decoding algorithms for erasure codes that upper bounds the severity of the deadlock. We use the peeling algorithm as a tool to compare the performance of different topologies as well as to aid in the synthesis of topologies robust to deadlocks.\\n        \",\n",

Achieving this in practice at reasonable network utilization has proved elusive, due to a combination of highly bursty application demand, faster link speeds, and heavy-tailed message sizes. While priority scheduling can be used to reduce tail latency for some traffic, this comes at a cost of much worse delay behavior for all other traffic on the network. Most operators choose to run their networks at very low average utilization, despite the added cost, and yet still suffer poor tail behavior.\\n  This paper takes a different approach. We build a system, swp, to help operators (and network designers) to understand and control tail latency without relying on priority scheduling. As network workload changes, swp is designed to give real-time advice on the network switch configurations needed to maintain tail latency objectives for each traffic class. The core of swp is an efficient model for simulating the combined effect of traffic characteristics, end-to-end congestion control, and switch scheduling on service-level objectives (SLOs), along with an optimizer that adjusts switch-level scheduling weights assigned to each class. Using simulation across a diverse set of workloads with different SLOs, we show that to meet the same SLOs as swp provides, FIFO would require 65% greater link capacity, and 79% more for scenarios with tight SLOs on bursty traffic classes.\\n        ',\n",

Since learned models inevitably make mistakes, the goal should be to improve the estimates that make the biggest difference to an optimizer. We introduce a new loss function, Flow-Loss, that explicitly optimizes for better query plans by approximating the optimizer's cost model and dynamic programming search algorithm with analytical functions. At the heart of Flow-Loss is a reduction of query optimization to a flow routing problem on a certain plan graph in which paths correspond to different query plans. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the Cardinality Estimation Benchmark, which contains the ground truth cardinalities for sub-plans of over 16K queries from 21 templates with up to 15 joins. We show that across different architectures and databases, a model trained with Flow-Loss improves the cost of plans (using the PostgreSQL cost model) and query runtimes despite having worse estimation accuracy than a model trained with Q-Error. When the test set queries closely match the training queries, both models improve performance significantly over PostgreSQL and are close to the optimal performance (using true cardinalities). However, the Q-Error trained model degrades significantly when evaluated on queries that are slightly different (e.g., similar but not identical query templates), while the Flow-Loss trained model generalizes better to such situations. For example, the Flow-Loss model achieves up to 1.5x better runtimes on unseen templates compared to the Q-Error model, despite leveraging the same model architecture and training data.\\n        \",\n",

However, this optimization is only available to queries that filter on the indexed attribute. To extend these speedups to queries on other attributes, database systems have turned to secondary and multi-dimensional indexes. Unfortunately, these approaches are restrictive: secondary indexes have a large memory footprint and can only speed up queries that access a small number of records, and multi-dimensional indexes cannot scale to more than a handful of columns. We present Cortex, an approach that takes advantage of correlations to extend the reach of primary indexes to more attributes. Unlike prior work, Cortex can adapt itself to any existing primary index, whether single or multi-dimensional, to harness a broad variety of correlations, such as those that exist between more than two attributes or have a large number of outliers.

In the Internet today, however, there is a mismatch between where queues build and where control is most effectively enforced; queues build at bottleneck links that are often not under the control of the data sender. To resolve this mismatch, we propose a new kind of middlebox, called Bundler. Bundler uses a novel inner control loop between a sendbox (in the sender's site) and a receivebox (in the receiver's site) to determine the aggregate rate for the bundle, leaving the end-to-end connections and their control loops intact. Enforcing this sending rate ensures that bottleneck queues that would have built up from the bundle's packets now shift from the bottleneck to the sendbox. The sendbox then exercises control over its traffic by scheduling packets to achieve higher-level objectives. We have implemented Bundler in Linux and evaluated it with real-world and emulation experiments. We find that Bundler allows the sender-chosen policy to be effective: when configured to implement Stochastic Fairness Queueing (SFQ), it improves median flow completion time (FCT) by between 28% and 97% across various scenarios.\\n        \",\n",

We evaluate Sat2Graph using two large datasets. We find that Sat2Graph surpasses prior methods on two widely used metrics, TOPO and APLS.

On the task of video semantic segmentation, our experimental results show 0.4--17.8 percent mean Intersection-over-Union improvement compared to a pre-trained model across several video datasets. Our prototype can perform video segmentation at 30 frames-per-second with 40 milliseconds camera-to-label latency on a Samsung Galaxy S10+ mobile phone, using less than 300 Kbps uplink and downlink bandwidth on the device.\\n        ',\n",

Such collectors must decide when to look for unreachable objects to free, which can have a large performance impact on some applications. In this preliminary work, we propose a design for a learned garbage collector that autonomously learns over time when to perform collections. By using reinforcement learning, our design can incorporate user-defined reward functions, allowing an autonomous garbage collector to learn to optimize the exact metric the user desires (e.g., request latency or queries per second). We conduct an initial experimental study on a prototype, demonstrating that an approach based on tabular Q learning may be promising.\\n        ',\n",

Recent efforts to apply machine learning techniques to query optimization challenges have been promising, but have shown few practical gains due to substantive training overhead, inability to adapt to changes, and poor tail performance. Motivated by these difficulties and drawing upon a long history of research in multi-armed bandits, we introduce Bao (the BAndit Optimizer). Bao takes advantage of the wisdom built into existing query optimizers by providing per-query optimization hints. Bao combines modern tree convolutional neural networks with Thompson sampling, a decades-old and well-studied reinforcement learning algorithm. As a result, Bao automatically learns from its mistakes and adapts to changes in query workloads, data, and schema. Experimentally, we demonstrate that Bao can quickly (an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches) learn strategies that improve end-to-end query execution performance, including tail latency. In cloud environments, we show that Bao can offer both reduced costs and better performance compared with a sophisticated commercial system.\\n        ',\n",

Often, due to the occlusion in satellite imagery and the spatial correlation of road attributes, a road attribute at one position on a road may only be apparent when considering far-away segments of the road. Thus, to robustly infer road attributes, the model must integrate scattered information and capture the spatial correlation of features along roads. Existing solutions that rely on image classifiers fail to capture this correlation, resulting in poor accuracy. We find this failure is caused by a fundamental limitation -- the limited effective receptive field of image classifiers. To overcome this limitation, we propose RoadTagger, an end-to-end architecture which combines both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to infer road attributes. The usage of graph neural networks allows information propagation on the road network graph and eliminates the receptive field limitation of image classifiers. We evaluate RoadTagger on both a large real-world dataset covering 688 km^2 area in 20 U.S. cities and a synthesized micro-dataset. In the evaluation, RoadTagger improves inference accuracy over the CNN image classifier based approaches. RoadTagger also demonstrates strong robustness against different disruptions in the satellite imagery and the ability to learn complicated inductive rules for aggregating scattered information along the road network.\\n        ',\n",

To optimize the performance of these operations, databases often create clustered indexes over a single dimension or multi-dimensional indexes such as R-trees, or use complex sort orders (e.g., Z-ordering). However, these schemes are often hard to tune and their performance is inconsistent across different datasets and queries. In this paper, we introduce Flood, a multi-dimensional in-memory index that automatically adapts itself to a particular dataset and workload by jointly optimizing the index structure and data storage. Flood achieves up to three orders of magnitude faster performance for range scans with predicates than state-of-the-art multi-dimensional indexes or sort orders on real-world datasets and workloads.

Editing maps today involves a tedious process of manually tracing and annotating roads, buildings, and other map features.\\n  Over the past decade, many automatic map inference systems have been proposed to automatically extract street map data from satellite imagery, aerial imagery, and GPS trajectory datasets. However, automatic map inference has failed to gain traction in practice due to two key limitations: high error rates (low precision), which manifest in noisy inference outputs, and a lack of end-to-end system design to leverage inferred data to update existing street maps.\\n  At MIT and QCRI, we have developed a number of algorithms and approaches to address these challenges, which we combined into a new system we call Mapster. Mapster is a human-in-the-loop street map editing system that incorporates three components to robustly accelerate the mapping process over traditional tools and workflows: high-precision automatic map inference, data refinement, and machine-assisted map editing.\\n  Through an evaluation on a large-scale dataset including satellite imagery, GPS trajectories, and ground-truth map data in forty cities, we show that Mapster makes automation practical for map editing, and enables the curation of map datasets that are more complete and up-to-date at less cost.\\n        ',\n",

Scaling the performance of Bitcoin has a been a major recent direction of research. One successful direction of work has involved replacing proof of work (PoW) by proof of stake (PoS). Proposals to scale the performance in the PoW setting itself have focused mostly on parallelizing the mining process, scaling throughput; the few proposals to improve latency have either sacrificed throughput or the latency guarantees involve large constants rendering it practically useless. Our first contribution is to design a new PoW blockchain Prism++ that has provably low latency and high throughput; the design retains the parallel-chain approach espoused in Prism but invents a new confirmation rule to infer the permanency of a block by combining information across the parallel chains. We show security at the level of Bitcoin with very small confirmation latency (a small constant factor of block interarrival time). A key aspect to scaling the performance is to use a large number of parallel chains, which puts significant strain on the system. Our second contribution is the design and evaluation of a practical system to efficiently manage the memory, computation, and I/O imperatives of a large number of parallel chains. Our implementation of Prism++ achieves a throughput of over 80,000 transactions per second and confirmation latency of tens of seconds on networks of up to 900 EC2 Virtual Machines.\\n        ',\n",

Widely deployed algorithms, such as DCTCP and DCQCN, are still far from optimal in many plausible scenarios, particularly for tail latency. Many operators compensate by running their networks at low average utilization, dramatically increasing costs.\\n  In this paper, we argue that we have reached the practical limits of end-to-end congestion control. Instead, we propose, implement, and evaluate a new congestion control architecture called Backpressure Flow Control (BFC). BFC provides per-hop per-flow flow control, but with bounded state, constant-time switch operations, and careful use of buffers. We demonstrate BFC's feasibility by implementing it on Tofino2, a state-of-the-art P4-based programmable hardware switch. In simulation, we show that BFC achieves near optimal throughput and tail latency behavior even under challenging conditions such as high network load and incast cross traffic. Compared to existing end-to-end schemes, BFC achieves 2.3 - 60 X lower tail latency for short flows and 1.6 - 5 X better average completion time for long flows.\\n        \",\n",

Unlike prior approaches that only find a device placement for a specific computation graph, Placeto can learn generalizable device placement policies that can be applied to any graph. We propose two key ideas in our approach: (1) we represent the policy as performing iterative placement improvements, rather than outputting a placement in one shot; (2) we use graph embeddings to capture relevant information about the structure of the computation graph, without relying on node labels for indexing. These ideas allow Placeto to train efficiently and generalize to unseen graphs. Our experiments show that Placeto requires up to 6.1x fewer training steps to find placements that are on par with or better than the best placements found by prior approaches. Moreover, Placeto is able to learn a generalizable placement policy for any given family of graphs, which can then be used without any retraining to predict optimized placements for unseen graphs from the same family. This eliminates the large overhead incurred by prior RL approaches whose lack of generalizability necessitates re-training from scratch every time a new graph is to be placed.\\n        ',\n",

We propose machine-assisted map editing, where automatic map inference is integrated into existing, human-centric map editing workflows. To realize this, we build Machine-Assisted iD (MAiD), where we extend the web-based OpenStreetMap editor, iD, with machine-assistance functionality. We complement MAiD with a novel approach for inferring road topology from aerial imagery that combines the speed of prior segmentation approaches with the accuracy of prior iterative graph construction methods. We design MAiD to tackle the addition of major, arterial roads in regions where existing maps have poor coverage, and the incremental improvement of coverage in regions where major roads are already mapped. We conduct two user studies and find that, when participants are given a fixed time to map roads, they are able to add as much as 3.5x more roads with MAiD.\\n        ',\n",

Several recently proposed learning-based approaches achieve promising results on simple channel models (e.g., i.i.d. Gaussian). However, their performance degrades significantly on real-world channels with spatial correlation. We propose MMNet, a deep learning MIMO detection scheme that significantly outperforms existing approaches on realistic channels with the same or lower computational complexity. MMNet's design builds on the theory of iterative soft-thresholding algorithms and uses a novel training algorithm that leverages temporal and spectral correlation to accelerate training. Together, these innovations allow MMNet to train online for every realization of the channel. On i.i.d. Gaussian channels, MMNet requires two orders of magnitude fewer operations than existing deep learning schemes but achieves near-optimal performance. On spatially-correlated channels, it achieves the same error rate as the next-best learning scheme (OAMPNet) at 2.5dB lower SNR and with at least 10x less computational complexity. MMNet is also 4--8dB better overall than a classic linear scheme like the minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector.\\n        \",\n",

Routers use this feedback to quickly guide senders towards a desired target rate. ABC requires no changes to header formats or user devices, but achieves better performance than XCP. ABC is also incrementally deployable; it operates correctly when the bottleneck is a non-ABC router, and can coexist with non-ABC traffic sharing the same bottleneck link. We evaluate ABC using a Wi-Fi implementation and trace-driven emulation of cellular links. ABC achieves 30-40% higher throughput than Cubic+Codel for similar delays, and 2.2X lower delays than BBR on a Wi-Fi path. On cellular network paths, ABC achieves 50% higher throughput than Cubic+Codel.\\n        ',\n",

Neo bootstraps its query optimization model from existing optimizers and continues to learn from incoming queries, building upon its successes and learning from its failures. Furthermore, Neo naturally adapts to underlying data patterns and is robust to estimation errors. Experimental results demonstrate that Neo, even when bootstrapped from a simple optimizer like PostgreSQL, can learn a model that offers similar performance to state-of-the-art commercial optimizers, and in some cases even surpass them.\\n        ',\n",

Decima uses reinforcement learning (RL) and neural networks to learn workload-specific scheduling algorithms without any human instruction beyond a high-level objective such as minimizing average job completion time. Off-the-shelf RL techniques, however, cannot handle the complexity and scale of the scheduling problem. To build Decima, we had to develop new representations for jobs' dependency graphs, design scalable RL models, and invent RL training methods for dealing with continuous stochastic job arrivals. Our prototype integration with Spark on a 25-node cluster shows that Decima improves the average job completion time over hand-tuned scheduling heuristics by at least 21%, achieving up to 2x improvement during periods of high cluster load.\\n        \",\n",

Payment channel networks (PCNs) such as the Lightning Network have emerged as a viable scaling solution. However, completing payments on PCNs is challenging: payments must be routed on paths with sufficient funds. As payments flow over a single channel (link) in the same direction, the channel eventually becomes depleted and cannot support further payments in that direction; hence, naive routing schemes like shortest-path routing can deplete key payment channels and paralyze the system. Today\\'s PCNs also route payments atomically, worsening the problem. In this paper, we present Spider, a routing solution that \"packetizes\" transactions and uses a multi-path transport protocol to achieve high-throughput routing in PCNs. Packetization allows Spider to complete even large transactions on low-capacity payment channels over time, while the multi-path congestion control protocol ensures balanced utilization of channels and fairness across flows. Extensive simulations comparing Spider with state-of-the-art approaches shows that Spider requires less than 25% of the funds to successfully route over 95% of transactions on balanced traffic demands, and offloads 4x more transactions onto the PCN on imbalanced demands.\\n        ',\n",

Since the state dynamics and rewards depend on the input process, the state alone provides limited information for the expected future returns. Therefore, policy gradient methods with standard state-dependent baselines suffer high variance during training. We derive a bias-free, input-dependent baseline to reduce this variance, and analytically show its benefits over state-dependent baselines. We then propose a meta-learning approach to overcome the complexity of learning a baseline that depends on a long sequence of inputs. Our experimental results show that across environments from queuing systems, computer networks, and MuJoCo robotic locomotion, input-dependent baselines consistently improve training stability and result in better eventual policies.\\n        ',\n",

To estimate elasticity, Nimbus modulates the flow\\'s sending rate with sinusoidal pulses that create small traffic fluctuations at the bottleneck link, and measures the frequency response of the rate of the cross traffic. Our results on emulated and real-world paths show that congestion control using elasticity detection achieves throughput comparable to Cubic, but with delays that are 50-70 ms lower when cross traffic is inelastic.

These excessive writes and erasures significantly shorten the lifetime of flash, rendering it impractical to use for key-value caches.

Flashield performs light-weight machine learning profiling to predict which objects are likely to be read frequently before getting updated; these objects, which are prime candidates to be stored on SSD, are written to SSD in large chunks sequentially. In order to efficiently utilize the cache\\'s available memory, we design a novel in-memory index for the variable-sized objects stored on flash that requires only 4 bytes per object in DRAM.

Sparsening techniques are used to compute the timeslice-to-all quark propagators required to form correlation-function matrices using products of these operators. Projection of these matrices onto irreducible representations of the cubic group, including spin-orbit coupling, is detailed. Variational methods are applied to constrain the low-energy spectra of two-nucleon systems in a single finite volume with quark masses corresponding to a pion mass of 806 MeV. Results for S- and D-wave phase shifts in the isospin singlet and triplet channels are obtained under the assumption that partial-wave mixing is negligible. Tests of interpolating-operator dependence are used to investigate the reliability of the energy spectra obtained and highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of variational methods. These studies and comparisons to previous studies using the same gauge-field ensemble demonstrate that interpolating-operator dependence can lead to significant effects on the two-nucleon energy spectra obtained using both variational and non-variational methods, including missing energy levels and other discrepancies. While this study is inconclusive regarding the presence of two-nucleon bound states at this quark mass, it provides robust upper bounds on two-nucleon energy levels that can be improved in future calculations using additional interpolating operators and is therefore a step toward reliable nuclear spectroscopy from the underlying Standard Model of particle physics.\\n        ',\n",

The input of the proposed model is a set of simple features representing the unoptimized code and a sequence of code transformations. The model predicts the speedup expected when the code transformations are applied. Unlike previous models, the proposed one works on full programs and does not rely on any heavy feature engineering. The proposed model has only 16% of mean absolute percentage error in predicting speedups on full programs. The proposed model enables Tiramisu to automatically find code transformations that match or are better than state-of-the-art compilers without requiring the same level of heavy feature engineering required by those compilers.\\n        ',\n",

No single set of optimizations or one hardware platform works well across all settings. To achieve high performance, the programmer must carefully select which set of optimizations and hardware platforms to use. The GraphIt programming language makes it easy for the programmer to write the algorithm once and optimize it for different inputs using a scheduling language. However, GraphIt currently has no support for generating high performance code for GPUs. Programmers must resort to re-implementing the entire algorithm from scratch in a low-level language with an entirely different set of abstractions and optimizations in order to achieve high performance on GPUs.\\n  We propose GG, an extension to the GraphIt compiler framework, that achieves high performance on both CPUs and GPUs using the same algorithm specification. GG significantly expands the optimization space of GPU graph processing frameworks with a novel GPU scheduling language and compiler that enables combining graph optimizations for GPUs. GG also introduces two performance optimizations, Edge-based Thread Warps CTAs load balancing (ETWC) and EdgeBlocking, to expand the optimization space for GPUs. ETWC improves load balancing by dynamically partitioning the edges of each vertex into blocks that are assigned to threads, warps, and CTAs for execution. EdgeBlocking improves the locality of the program by reordering the edges and restricting random memory accesses to fit within the L2 cache. We evaluate GG on 5 algorithms and 9 input graphs on both Pascal and Volta generation NVIDIA GPUs, and show that it achieves up to 5.11x speedup over state-of-the-art GPU graph processing frameworks, and is the fastest on 66 out of the 90 experiments.\\n        ',\n",

We use the same seq2seq model to translate at all phrase scales, which results in two inference modes: one mode in which the parser is discarded and only the seq2seq component is used at the sequence-level, and another in which the parser is combined with the seq2seq model. Decoding in the latter mode is done with the cube-pruned CKY algorithm, which is more involved but can make use of new translation rules during inference.

In this work, we leverage natural language descriptions for a diverse set of 2K procedurally generated objects to identify the parts people use and the principles leading these parts to be favored over others. We formalize our problem as search over a space of program libraries that contain different part concepts, using tools from machine translation to evaluate how well programs expressed in each library align to human language.

In these cases, corrections provide a valuable tool for human-in-the-loop robot control. Corrections might take the form of new goal specifications, new constraints (e.g. to avoid specific objects), or hints for planning algorithms (e.g. to visit specific waypoints). Existing correction methods (e.g. using a joystick or direct manipulation of an end effector) require full teleoperation or real-time interaction. In this paper, we explore natural language as an expressive and flexible tool for robot correction. We describe how to map from natural language sentences to transformations of cost functions. We show that these transformations enable users to correct goals, update robot motions to accommodate additional user preferences, and recover from planning errors. These corrections can be leveraged to get 81% and 93% success rates on tasks where the original planner failed, with either one or two language corrections. Our method makes it possible to compose multiple constraints and generalizes to unseen scenes, objects, and sentences in simulated environments and real-world environments.\\n        \",\n",

Can we overcome these challenges by building agents that learn from rich, interactive feedback instead? We propose a new supervision paradigm for interactive learning based on \"teachable\" decision-making systems that learn from structured advice provided by an external teacher. We begin by formalizing a class of human-in-the-loop decision making problems in which multiple forms of teacher-provided advice are available to a learner. We then describe a simple learning algorithm for these problems that first learns to interpret advice, then learns from advice to complete tasks even in the absence of human supervision. In puzzle-solving, navigation, and locomotion domains, we show that agents that learn from advice can acquire new skills with significantly less human supervision than standard reinforcement learning algorithms and often less than imitation learning.\\n        ',\n",

We propose an approach for using LMs to scaffold learning and generalization in general sequential decision-making problems. In this approach, goals and observations are represented as a sequence of embeddings, and a policy network initialized with a pre-trained LM predicts the next action. We demonstrate that this framework enables effective combinatorial generalization across different environments and supervisory modalities. We begin by assuming access to a set of expert demonstrations, and show that initializing policies with LMs and fine-tuning them via behavior cloning improves task completion rates by 43.6% in the VirtualHome environment. Next, we integrate an active data gathering procedure in which agents iteratively interact with the environment, relabel past \"failed\" experiences with new goals, and update their policies in a self-supervised loop. Active data gathering further improves combinatorial generalization, outperforming the best baseline by 25.1%. Finally, we explain these results by investigating three possible factors underlying the effectiveness of the LM-based policy. We find that sequential input representations (vs. fixed-dimensional feature vectors) and LM-based weight initialization are both important for generalization. Surprisingly, however, the format of the policy inputs encoding (e.g. as a natural language string vs. an arbitrary sequential encoding) has little influence. Together, these results suggest that language modeling induces representations that are useful for modeling not just language, but also goals and plans; these representations can aid learning and generalization even outside of language processing.\\n        ',\n",

A large body of work in natural language processing seeks to overcome this limitation with new model architectures that enforce a compositional process of sentence interpretation. In this paper, we present a domain-general framework for compositional modeling that instead formulates compositionality as a constraint on data distributions. We prove that for any task factorizable into a lexicon and a composition function, there exists a family of data transformation functions that are guaranteed to produce new, well-formed examples when applied to training data. We further show that it is possible to identify these data transformations even when the composition function is unknown (e.g. when we do not know how to write or infer a symbolic grammar). Using these transformation functions to perform data augmentation for ordinary RNN and transformer sequence models, we obtain state-of-the-art results on the CLEVR-CoGenT visual question answering dataset, and results comparable to specialized model architectures on the COGS semantic parsing dataset.\\n        ',\n",

In computer vision, techniques exist for identifying neurons that respond to individual concept categories like colors, textures, and object classes. But these techniques are limited in scope, labeling only a small subset of neurons and behaviors in any network. Is a richer characterization of neuron-level computation possible? We introduce a procedure (called MILAN, for mutual-information-guided linguistic annotation of neurons) that automatically labels neurons with open-ended, compositional, natural language descriptions. Given a neuron, MILAN generates a description by searching for a natural language string that maximizes pointwise mutual information with the image regions in which the neuron is active. MILAN produces fine-grained descriptions that capture categorical, relational, and logical structure in learned features. These descriptions obtain high agreement with human-generated feature descriptions across a diverse set of model architectures and tasks, and can aid in understanding and controlling learned models. We highlight three applications of natural language neuron descriptions. First, we use MILAN for analysis, characterizing the distribution and importance of neurons selective for attribute, category, and relational information in vision models. Second, we use MILAN for auditing, surfacing neurons sensitive to human faces in datasets designed to obscure them. Finally, we use MILAN for editing, improving robustness in an image classifier by deleting neurons sensitive to text features spuriously correlated with class labels.\\n        ',\n",

We show in chess and Go that regularizing search based on the KL divergence from an imitation-learned policy results in higher human prediction accuracy and stronger performance than imitation learning alone.

In NLP, systematic features of LM generalization to individual examples are well characterized, but systematic aspects of LM adaptability to new tasks are not nearly as well understood. We present a large-scale empirical study of the features and limits of LM adaptability using a new benchmark, TaskBench500, built from 500 procedurally generated sequence modeling tasks. These tasks combine core aspects of language processing, including lexical semantics, sequence processing, memorization, logical reasoning, and world knowledge. Using TaskBench500, we evaluate three facets of adaptability, finding that: (1) adaptation procedures differ dramatically in their ability to memorize small datasets; (2) within a subset of task types, adaptation procedures exhibit compositional adaptability to complex tasks; and (3) failure to match training label distributions is explained by mismatches in the intrinsic difficulty of predicting individual labels. Our experiments show that adaptability to new tasks, like generalization to new examples, can be systematically described and understood, and we conclude with a discussion of additional aspects of adaptability that could be studied using the new benchmark.\\n        ',\n",

We show that RNN and transformer language models exhibit structured, consistent generalization in out-of-distribution contexts. We begin by introducing two idealized models of generalization in next-word prediction: a local context model in which generalization is consistent with the last word observed, and a global context model in which generalization is consistent with the global structure of the input. In experiments in English, Finnish, Mandarin, and random regular languages, we demonstrate that neural language models interpolate between these two forms of generalization: their predictions are well-approximated by a log-linear combination of local and global predictive distributions. We then show that, in some languages, noise mediates the two forms of generalization: noise applied to input tokens encourages global generalization, while noise in history representations encourages local generalization. Finally, we offer a preliminary theoretical explanation of these results by proving that the observed interpolation behavior is expected in log-linear models with a particular feature correlation structure. These results help explain the effectiveness of two popular regularization schemes and show that aspects of sequence model generalization can be understood and controlled.\\n        ',\n",

In this paper, we present an extremely simple approach that enables the use of ordinary logistic regression classifiers for few-shot incremental learning. The key to this approach is a new family of subspace regularization schemes that encourage weight vectors for new classes to lie close to the subspace spanned by the weights of existing classes. When combined with pretrained convolutional feature extractors, logistic regression models trained with subspace regularization outperform specialized, state-of-the-art approaches to few-shot incremental image classification by up to 22% on the miniImageNet dataset. Because of its simplicity, subspace regularization can be straightforwardly extended to incorporate additional background information about the new classes (including class names and descriptions specified in natural language); these further improve accuracy by up to 2%.

We describe how to train this model using primarily unannotated demonstrations by parsing demonstrations into sequences of named high-level subtasks, using only a small number of seed annotations to ground language in action. In trained models, natural language commands index a combinatorial library of skills; agents can use these skills to plan by generating high-level instruction sequences tailored to novel goals. We evaluate this approach in the ALFRED household simulation environment, providing natural language annotations for only 10% of demonstrations.

This paper details a roadmap toward this goal based on currently existing technology and multidisciplinary scientific community effort. We outline the key elements required for the collection and processing of massive bioacoustic data of sperm whales, detecting their basic communication units and language-like higher-level structures, and validating these models through interactive playback experiments.

We introduce a general technique for representing partially written programs in a program synthesis engine. We take inspiration from the technique of abstract interpretation, in which an approximate execution model is used to determine if an unfinished program will eventually satisfy a goal specification. Here we learn an approximate execution model implemented as a modular neural network. By constructing compositional program representations that implicitly encode the interpretation semantics of the underlying programming language, we can represent partial programs using a flexible combination of concrete execution state and learned neural representations, using the learned approximate semantics when concrete semantics are not known (in unfinished parts of the program). We show that these hybrid neuro-symbolic representations enable execution-guided synthesizers to use more powerful language constructs, such as loops and higher-order functions, and can be used to synthesize programs more accurately for a given search budget than pure neural approaches in several domains.\\n        ',\n",

Natural language instructions typically identify only a few high-level decisions and landmarks rather than complete low-level motor behaviors; much of the missing information must be inferred based on perceptual context. In machine learning settings, this is doubly challenging: it is difficult to collect enough annotated data to enable learning of this reasoning process from scratch, and also difficult to implement the reasoning process using generic sequence models. Here we describe an approach to vision-and-language navigation that addresses both these issues with an embedded speaker model. We use this speaker model to (1) synthesize new instructions for data augmentation and to (2) implement pragmatic reasoning, which evaluates how well candidate action sequences explain an instruction. Both steps are supported by a panoramic action space that reflects the granularity of human-generated instructions. Experiments show that all three components of this approach---speaker-driven data augmentation, pragmatic reasoning and panoramic action space---dramatically improve the performance of a baseline instruction follower, more than doubling the success rate over the best existing approach on a standard benchmark.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        We show that explicit pragmatic inference aids in correctly generating and following natural language instructions for complex, sequential tasks. Our pragmatics-enabled models reason about why speakers produce certain instructions, and about how listeners will react upon hearing them. Like previous pragmatic models, we use learned base listener and speaker models to build a pragmatic speaker that uses the base listener to simulate the interpretation of candidate descriptions, and a pragmatic listener that reasons counterfactually about alternative descriptions. We extend these models to tasks with sequential structure. Evaluation of language generation and interpretation shows that pragmatic inference improves state-of-the-art listener models (at correctly interpreting human instructions) and speaker models (at producing instructions correctly interpreted by humans) in diverse settings.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Deep reinforcement learning has achieved many recent successes, but our understanding of its strengths and limitations is hampered by the lack of rich environments in which we can fully characterize optimal behavior, and correspondingly diagnose individual actions against such a characterization. Here we consider a family of combinatorial games, arising from work of Erdos, Selfridge, and Spencer, and we propose their use as environments for evaluating and comparing different approaches to reinforcement learning. These games have a number of appealing features: they are challenging for current learning approaches, but they form (i) a low-dimensional, simply parametrized environment where (ii) there is a linear closed form solution for optimal behavior from any state, and (iii) the difficulty of the game can be tuned by changing environment parameters in an interpretable way. We use these Erdos-Selfridge-Spencer games not only to compare different algorithms, but test for generalization, make comparisons to supervised learning, analyse multiagent play, and even develop a self play algorithm.

Can this linguistic background knowledge improve the generality and efficiency of learned classifiers and control policies? This paper aims to show that using the space of natural language strings as a parameter space is an effective way to capture natural task structure. In a pretraining phase, we learn a language interpretation model that transforms inputs (e.g. images) into outputs (e.g. labels) given natural language descriptions. To learn a new concept (e.g. a classifier), we search directly in the space of descriptions to minimize the interpreter's loss on training examples. Crucially, our models do not require language data to learn these concepts: language is used only in pretraining to impose structure on subsequent learning.

Here, we show that this structural transition in antiferroelectric ZrO$_2$ gives rise to a negative capacitance, which is promising for overcoming the fundamental limits of energy efficiency in electronics. Our findings provide insight into the thermodynamically 'forbidden' region of the antiferroelectric transition in ZrO$_2$ and extend the concept of negative capacitance beyond ferroelectricity.

Therefore, it is important to determine the causes of oscillations in a network. Whether a network can oscillate can be estimated if we know the strength of interaction between nodes. But in real-world networks (in particular in biological networks) it is usually not possible to know the exact connection weights. Therefore, it is important to determine the structural properties of a network necessary to generate oscillations. Here, we provide a proof that uses dynamical system theory to prove that an odd number of inhibitory nodes and strong enough connections are necessary to generate oscillations in a single cycle threshold-linear network. We illustrate these analytical results in a biologically plausible network with either firing-rate based or spiking neurons.

Simulations have shown that 0.01-0.1M$_\\\\odot$ of r-process material could be generated in the outflows originating from the accretion disk surrounding the rapidly rotating black hole that forms as a remnant to both neutron star mergers and collapsing massive stars associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (collapsars). The hallmark signature of r-process nucleosynthesis in the binary neutron star merger GW170817 was its long-lasting near-infrared emission, thus motivating a systematic photometric study of the light curves of broadlined stripped-envelope (Ic-BL) supernovae (SNe) associated with collapsars. We present the first systematic study of 25 SNe Ic-BL -- discovered with the Zwicky Transient Facility and from the literature -- in the optical/near-infrared bands to determine what quantity of r-process material, if any, is synthesized in these explosions. Using semi-analytic models designed to account for r-process production in SNe Ic-BL, we perform light curve fitting to derive constraints on the r-process mass for these SNe. We also perform independent light curve fits to models without r-process. We find that the r-process-free models are a better fit to the light curves of the objects in our sample. Thus we conclude that there is no compelling evidence of r-process enrichment in any of our objects. Further high-cadence infrared photometric studies and nebular spectroscopic analysis would be sensitive to smaller quantities of r-process ejecta mass or indicate whether all collapsars are completely devoid of r-process nucleosynthesis.\\n        ',\n",

In this paper, we specifically focus on non-canonical warm inflationary scenarios and study a model of warm Higgs-G inflation, in which the Standard Model Higgs boson drives inflation, with a Galileon-like non-linear kinetic term. We show that in the Galileon-dominated regime, the primordial power spectrum is strongly enhanced, leading to the formation of primordial black holes (PBH) with a wide range of the mass spectrum. Interestingly, PBHs in the asteroid mass window $\\\\sim (10^{17}$ -- $10^{23}$) g are generated in this model, which can explain the total abundance of the dark matter in the Universe. In our analysis, we also calculate the secondary gravitational waves (GW) sourced by these small-scale overdense fluctuations and find that the induced GW spectrum can be detected in the future GW detectors, such as LISA, BBO, DECIGO, etc. Our scenario thus provides a novel way of generating PBHs as dark matter and a detectable stochastic GW background from warm inflation. We also show that our scenario is consistent with the swampland and the trans-Planckian censorship conjectures and, thus, remains in the viable landscape of UV complete theories.\\n        ',\n",

Information of the agent's past affects the agent's instantaneous movement in order to swiftly take the agent towards its desired state. We show how the presence of memory is akin to an agent performing a proportional-integral control to achieve its desired state. The longer the agent remembers and the more impact the memory has on its motion, better is the movement of an isolated agent in terms of achieving its desired state. However, when in a collective, the interactions between the agents lead to non-monotonic effect of memory on the traffic dynamics. A group of agents with memory exiting through a narrow door exhibit more clogging with memory than without it. We also show that a very large amount of memory results in variation in the memory force experienced by agents in the system at any time, which reduces the propensity to form clogs and leads to efficient movement.\\n        \",\n",

However, the accuracy of traditional GP-ROMs degrades over long time prediction horizons. To address this issue, we extend the recently proposed Neural Galerkin Projection (NeuralGP) data driven framework to compressibility-dominated transonic flow, considering a prototypical problem of a buffeting NACA0012 airfoil governed by the full Navier-Stokes equations. The algorithm maintains the form of the ROM-ODE obtained from the Galerkin projection; however coefficients are learned directly from the data using gradient descent facilitated by differentiable programming. This blends the strengths of the physics driven GP-ROM and purely data driven neural network-based techniques, resulting in a computationally cheaper model that is easier to interpret. We show that the NeuralGP method minimizes a more rigorous full trajectory error norm compared to a linearized error definition optimized by the calibration procedure. We also find that while both procedures stabilize the ROM by displacing the eigenvalues of the linear dynamics matrix of the ROM-ODE to the complex left half-plane, the NeuralGP algorithm adds more dissipation to the trailing POD modes resulting in its better long-term performance.

The algorithm developed in this work applies Mori\\'s linear projection operator and an SVD based compression to the selection of the resolved variables (equivalently, a low rank approximation of the two time covariance matrices). We show that this MZ decomposition not only identifies the same spatio-temporal structures found by DMD, but it can also be used to extract spatio-temporal structures of the hysteresis effects present in the memory kernels. We perform an analysis of these structures in the context of a laminar-turbulent boundary-layer transition flow over a flared cone at Mach 6, and show the dynamical relevance of the memory kernels. Additionally, by including these memory terms learned in our data-driven MZ approach, we show improvement in prediction accuracy over DMD at the same level of truncation and at a similar computational cost. Furthermore, an analysis of the spatio-temporal structures of the MZ operators shows identifiable structures associated with the nonlinear generation of the so-called \"hot\" streaks on the surface of the flared code, which have previously been observed in experiments and direct numerical simulations.\\n        ',\n",

We employ a simple identity from the Fourier analysis of Boolean functions, which transforms the problem of counting constrained codewords of linear codes to a question about the structure of the dual code. We illustrate the utility of our method in providing explicit values or efficient algorithms for our counting problem, by showing that the Fourier transform of the indicator function of the constraint is computable, for different constraints. Our second approach is to obtain good upper bounds, using an extension of Delsarte's linear program (LP), on the largest sizes of constrained codes that can correct a fixed number of combinatorial errors or erasures.

However, the robustness of such networks has heretofore not been explored. This is particularly relevant given the broad social implications of such technologies and the fact that biologically small perturbations in the protein sequence do not generally lead to drastic changes in the protein structure. In this paper, we demonstrate that AlphaFold does not exhibit such robustness despite its high accuracy. This raises the challenge of detecting and quantifying the extent to which these predicted protein structures can be trusted. To measure the robustness of the predicted structures, we utilize (i) the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and (ii) the Global Distance Test (GDT) similarity measure between the predicted structure of the original sequence and the structure of its adversarially perturbed version. We prove that the problem of minimally perturbing protein sequences to fool protein folding neural networks is NP-complete. Based on the well-established BLOSUM62 sequence alignment scoring matrix, we generate adversarial protein sequences and show that the RMSD between the predicted protein structure and the structure of the original sequence are very large when the adversarial changes are bounded by (i) 20 units in the BLOSUM62 distance, and (ii) five residues (out of hundreds or thousands of residues) in the given protein sequence. In our experimental evaluation, we consider 111 COVID-19 proteins in the Universal Protein resource (UniProt), a central resource for protein data managed by the European Bioinformatics Institute, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, and the US Protein Information Resource.

       " '\\n        This paper presents a simulation testbed developed for testing and demonstration of decentralized control algorithms designed for multi-agent systems. Aimed at bridging a gap between theory and practical deployment of such algorithms, this testbed provides a simulator with multi-agent systems having quadcopter agents. It is used to test the control algorithms designed assuming simple agent dynamics like a single or double integrator. This is based on the fact that under certain assumptions, quadcopter dynamics can be modeled as a double integrator system. A gazebo simulator with a physics engine as ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) is used for simulating the dynamics of the quadcopter. Robot Operating System is used to develop communication networks and motion control algorithms for the different agents in the simulation testbed. The performance of the test bed is analyzed by implementing linear control laws such as position control, leaderless consensus, leader-follower consensus, and non-linear control law for min-max time consensus.

       " '\\n        Inverse problems constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs) play a critical role in model development and calibration. In many applications, there are multiple uncertain parameters in a model which must be estimated. Although the Bayesian formulation is attractive for such problems, computational cost and high dimensionality frequently prohibit a thorough exploration of the parametric uncertainty. A common approach is to reduce the dimension by fixing some parameters (which we will call auxiliary parameters) to a best estimate and use techniques from PDE-constrained optimization to approximate properties of the Bayesian posterior distribution. For instance, the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) and the Laplace approximation of the posterior covariance can be computed. In this article, we propose using hyper-differential sensitivity analysis (HDSA) to assess the sensitivity of the MAP point to changes in the auxiliary parameters. We establish an interpretation of HDSA as correlations in the posterior distribution. Our proposed framework is demonstrated on the inversion of bedrock topography for the Greenland ice sheet with uncertainties arising from the basal friction coefficient and climate forcing (ice accumulation rate)\\n        ',\n",

Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) for 26 FUV bright member BSSs are created using data from the UVIT, UVOT, Gaia EDR3, and the 2.2 m ESO/MPI telescope. A single SED is fitted to 14 BSSs, whereas double-SED fits revealed ELM WDs as binary companions in 12 of the 26 BSSs studied. The effective temperature, radius, luminosity and mass of the 12 ELM WDs are found to have a range (Teff = 9750-18000 K, R = 0.1-0.4 Rsun, L = 0.4-3.3 Lsun, and M =0.16-0.20 Msun). These suggest that 12 BSSs are post-mass-transfer systems formed through Case A/B mass transfer pathway. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first finding of ELM WDs as companions to BSS in globular clusters. This cluster is known to have a binary BSS sequence and the 12 binary and 14 single BSSs (as classified by the SEDs) follow the mass transfer and collisional sequence of BSS in the colour-magnitude diagram. The cooling ages of 9 of the ELM WDs are found to be younger than 500 Myr. Though the binary BSSs may have formed during the core-collapse (approx 200 Myr) or as part of the dynamical evolution of the cluster, they provide new insights on the dynamics of this cluster.\\n        ',\n",

       " \"\\n        A central problem of materials science is to determine whether a hypothetical material is stable without being synthesized, which is mathematically equivalent to a global optimization problem on a highly non-linear and multi-modal potential energy surface (PES). This optimization problem poses multiple outstanding challenges, including the exceedingly high dimensionality of the PES and that PES must be constructed from a reliable, sophisticated, parameters-free, and thus, very expensive computational method, for which density functional theory (DFT) is an example. DFT is a quantum mechanics based method that can predict, among other things, the total potential energy of a given configuration of atoms. DFT, while accurate, is computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a novel expansion-exploration-exploitation framework to find the global minimum of the PES. Starting from a few atomic configurations, this ``known'' space is expanded to construct a big candidate set. The expansion begins in a non-adaptive manner, where new configurations are added without considering their potential energy. A novel feature of this step is that it tends to generate a space-filling design without the knowledge of the boundaries of the domain space. If needed, the non-adaptive expansion of the space of configurations is followed by adaptive expansion, where ``promising regions'' of the domain space (those with low energy configurations) are further expanded. Once a candidate set of configurations is obtained, it is simultaneously explored and exploited using Bayesian optimization to find the global minimum. The methodology is demonstrated using a problem of finding the most stable crystal structure of Aluminum.\\n        \",\n",

ML is being applied more often to complex problems beyond those of computer vision. However, current frameworks often serve as black boxes and lack physics embeddings, leading to poor ability in enforcing constraints and unreliable models. In this work, we develop physics embeddings that can be stringently imposed, referred to as hard constraints, in the neural network architecture. We demonstrate their capability for 3D turbulence by embedding them in GANs, particularly to enforce the mass conservation constraint in incompressible fluid turbulence. In doing so, we also explore and contrast the effects of other methods of imposing physics constraints within the GANs framework, especially penalty-based physics constraints popular in literature. By using physics-informed diagnostics and statistics, we evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of our approach and demonstrate its feasibility.\\n        ',\n",

Twenty computer science AI graduate students evaluated the two models, on three tasks, at three difficulty levels, across ten prompts each, providing 3,600 ratings. Text-to-image generation has seen rapid progress to the point that many recent models have demonstrated their ability to create realistic high-resolution images for various prompts. However, current text-to-image methods and the broader body of research in vision-language understanding still struggle with intricate text prompts that contain many objects with multiple attributes and relationships. We introduce a new text-to-image benchmark that contains a suite of thirty-two tasks over multiple applications that capture a model's ability to handle different features of a text prompt. For example, asking a model to generate a varying number of the same object to measure its ability to count or providing a text prompt with several objects that each have a different attribute to identify its ability to match objects and attributes correctly. Rather than subjectively evaluating text-to-image results on a set of prompts, our new multi-task benchmark consists of challenge tasks at three difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard) and human ratings for each generated image.\\n        \",\n",

Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection can act as a safety monitor for ML models by identifying such samples at run time. However, in safety critical systems like AVs, OOD detection needs to satisfy real-time constraints in addition to functional requirements. In this demonstration, we use a mobile robot as a surrogate for an AV and use an OOD detector to identify potentially hazardous samples. The robot navigates a miniature town using image data and a YOLO object detection network. We show that our OOD detector is capable of identifying OOD images in real-time on an embedded platform concurrently performing object detection and lane following.

The use of these tools became very instrumental since the observation of fluid-like behavior in high-multiplicity pp collisions. In particular, the study as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity registered in the forward V0 ALICE detector allowed for the discovery of strangeness enhancement in high-multiplicity pp collisions. However, one drawback of the multiplicity-based event classifiers is that requiring a high charged-particle multiplicity biases the sample towards hard processes like multi-jet final states. These biases make it difficult to perform jet-quenching searches in high-multiplicity pp collisions. In this context, the present paper explores the use of the new event classifier, flattenicity; which uses the multiplicity calculated in the forward pseudorapidity region. To illustrate how this tool works, pp collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV simulated with PYTHIA~8 are explored. The sensitivity of flattencity to multi-partonic interactions as well as to the ``hardness'' of the collision are discussed. PYTHIA 8 predictions for the transverse momentum spectra of light- and heavy-flavored hadrons as a function of flattenicity are presented.\\n        \",\n",

Our focus is on the $(d,\\\\infty)$-runlength limited (RLL) constraint, which mandates that any pair of successive $1$s be separated by at least $d$ $0$s. In our study, we first consider $(d,\\\\infty)$-RLL subcodes of RM codes, taking the coordinates of the RM codes to be in the standard lexicographic ordering.

We then show that our construction is essentially rate-optimal, by deriving an upper bound on the rates of linear $(d,\\\\infty)$-RLL subcodes of RM codes of rate $R$. Next, for the special case when $d=1$, we prove the existence of potentially non-linear $(1,\\\\infty)$-RLL subcodes that achieve a rate of $\\\\max\\\\left(0,R-\\\\frac38\\\\right)$. This, for $R > 3/4$, beats the $R/2$ rate obtainable from linear subcodes.

We then shift our attention to settings where the coordinates of the RM code are not ordered according to the lexicographic ordering, and derive rate upper bounds for linear $(d,\\\\infty)$-RLL subcodes in these cases as well. Finally, we present a new two-stage constrained coding scheme, again using RM codes of rate $R$, which outperforms any linear coding scheme using $(d,\\\\infty)$-RLL subcodes, for values of $R$ close to $1$.\\n        ',\n",

During the process of drug discovery specifically, protein-ligand docking, or chemical docking, is a standard in-silico scoring technique that estimates the binding affinity of molecules with a specific protein target. Recently, however, as the number of virtual molecules available to test has rapidly grown, these classical docking algorithms have created a significant computational bottleneck. We address this problem by introducing Deep Surrogate Docking (DSD), a framework that applies deep learning-based surrogate modeling to accelerate the docking process substantially. DSD can be interpreted as a formalism of several earlier surrogate prefiltering techniques, adding novel metrics and practical training practices. Specifically, we show that graph neural networks (GNNs) can serve as fast and accurate estimators of classical docking algorithms. Additionally, we introduce FiLMv2, a novel GNN architecture which we show outperforms existing state-of-the-art GNN architectures, attaining more accurate and stable performance by allowing the model to filter out irrelevant information from data more efficiently. Through extensive experimentation and analysis, we show that the DSD workflow combined with the FiLMv2 architecture provides a 9.496x speedup in molecule screening with a <3% recall error rate on an example docking task.

Here, we combine active and unsupervised learning for automated exploration of novel behaviors in non-equilibrium systems with unknown order parameters. We iteratively use active learning based on current order parameters to expand the library of known behaviors and then relearn order parameters based on this expanded library. We demonstrate the utility of this approach in Kuramoto models of coupled oscillators of increasing complexity.

By periodically switching targets in a given design algorithm, we can teach a material to perform incompatible functionalities with minimal changes in design parameters. We exhibit this learning strategy for adaptability in two simulated settings: elastic networks that are designed to switch deformation modes with minimal bond changes; and heteropolymers whose folding pathway selections are controlled by a minimal set of monomer affinities.

Cross-organism comparison, in turn, enables a wide variety of research including whole-brain analysis of functional networks and linking the activity of specific neurons to behavior or environmental stimuli. The recent development of three-dimensional, pan-neuronal imaging with single-cell resolution within Caenorhabditis elegans has brought neuron identification, tracking, and activity monitoring all within reach. The nematode C. elegans is often used as a model organism to study neuronal activity due to factors such as its transparency and well-understood nervous system. The principal barrier to high-accuracy neuron identification is that in adult C. elegans, the position of neuronal cell bodies is not stereotyped. Existing approaches to address this issue use genetically encoded markers as an additional identifying feature. For example, the NeuroPAL strain uses multicolored fluorescent reporters. However, this approach has limited use due to the negative effects of excessive genetic modification. In this study, I propose an alternative neuronal identification technique using only single-color fluorescent images. I designed a novel neural network based classifier that automatically labels sensory neurons using an iterative, landmark-based neuron identification process inspired by the manual annotation procedures that humans employ. This design labels sensory neurons in C. elegans with 91.61% accuracy.\\n        ',\n",

Recently there have been promising results for OOD detection in the latent space of variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, without disentanglement, VAEs cannot perform OOD reasoning. Disentanglement ensures a one- to-many mapping between generative factors of OOD (e.g., rain in image data) and the latent variables to which they are encoded. Although previous literature has focused on weakly-supervised disentanglement on simple datasets with known and independent generative factors. In practice, achieving full disentanglement through weak supervision is impossible for complex datasets, such as Carla, with unknown and abstract generative factors. As a result, we propose an OOD reasoning framework that learns a partially disentangled VAE to reason about complex datasets. Our framework consists of three steps: partitioning data based on observed generative factors, training a VAE as a logic tensor network that satisfies disentanglement rules, and run-time OOD reasoning. We evaluate our approach on the Carla dataset and compare the results against three state-of-the-art methods. We found that our framework outperformed these methods in terms of disentanglement and end-to-end OOD reasoning.\\n        ',\n",

A vast majority of prior work focuses on detecting node/edge/subgraph anomalies within a single graph, with much less work on graph-level anomaly detection in a graph database. This work aims to fill two gaps in the literature: We (1) design GLAM, an end-to-end graph-level anomaly detection model based on GNNs, and (2) focus on unsupervised model selection, which is notoriously hard due to lack of any labels, yet especially critical for deep NN based models with a long list of hyper-parameters. Further, we propose a new pooling strategy for graph-level embedding, called MMD-pooling, that is geared toward detecting distribution anomalies which has not been considered before. Through extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets, we show that (i) GLAM outperforms node-level and two-stage (i.e. not end-to-end) baselines, and (ii) model selection picks a significantly more effective model than expectation (i.e. average) -- without using any labels -- among candidates with otherwise large variation in performance.\\n        ',\n",

We show that our system can adapt to different camera configurations and allows real-time execution for typical robotic applications.

To overcome this issue, we proposed a subject-specific, patch-based, unsupervised learning algorithm to estimate the susceptibility map. We make the problem well-posed by exploiting the redundancies across the patches of the map using a deep convolutional neural network.

In our work, we compare different classifiers, namely Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), XGBoost and CatBoost, and classify sources into three classes - star, quasar, and galaxy, with the target quasar and galaxy class labels obtained from SDSS16 and the star label from Gaia EDR3. In our approach, we adjust the posterior probabilities to reflect the intrinsic distribution of extragalactic sources in the universe via a prior function. We introduce two priors, a global prior reflecting the overall rarity of quasars and galaxies, and a mixed prior that incorporates in addition the distribution of the these sources as a function of Galactic latitude and magnitude. Our best classification performances, in terms of completeness and purity of the galaxy and quasar classes, are achieved using the mixed prior for sources at high latitudes and in the magnitude range G = 18.5 to 19.5. We apply our identified best-performing classifier to three application datasets from Gaia DR3, and find that the global prior is more conservative in what it considers to be a quasar or a galaxy compared to the mixed prior. In particular, when applied to the pure quasar and galaxy candidates samples, we attain a purity of 97% for quasars and 99.9% for galaxies using the global prior, and purities of 96% and 99% respectively using the mixed prior.

To address this challenge, much work has studied automatically processing geospatial data sources such as GPS trajectories and satellite images to reduce the cost of maintaining digital maps. An end-to-end map update system would first process geospatial data sources to extract insights, and second leverage those insights to update and improve the map. However, prior work largely focuses on the first step of this pipeline: these map extraction methods infer road networks from scratch given geospatial data sources (in effect creating entirely new maps), but do not address the second step of leveraging this extracted information to update the existing digital map data. In this paper, we first explain why current map extraction techniques yield low accuracy when extended to update existing maps. We then propose a novel method that leverages the progression of satellite imagery over time to substantially improve accuracy. Our approach first compares satellite images captured at different times to identify portions of the physical road network that have visibly changed, and then updates the existing map accordingly. We show that our change-based approach reduces map update error rates four-fold.\\n        ',\n",

A mobility platform should allocate tasks to vehicles and schedule them in order to optimize both throughput and fairness across customers. However, existing approaches to scheduling tasks in mobility platforms ignore fairness.\\n  We introduce Mobius, a system that uses guided optimization to achieve both high throughput and fairness across customers. Mobius supports spatiotemporally diverse and dynamic customer demands. It provides a principled method to navigate inherent tradeoffs between fairness and throughput caused by shared mobility. Our evaluation demonstrates these properties, along with the versatility and scalability of Mobius, using traces gathered from ridesharing and aerial sensing applications.

However, creating these data-sets is time-consuming and expensive since it relies on human annotators. We design, implement, and evaluate TagMe, a new approach for automatic object annotation in videos that uses GPS data. When the GPS trace of an object is available, TagMe matches the object's motion from GPS trace and the pixels' motions in the video to find the pixels belonging to the object in the video and creates the bounding box annotations of the object. TagMe works using passive data collection and can continuously generate new object annotations from outdoor video streams without any human annotators. We evaluate TagMe on a dataset of 100 video clips. We show TagMe can produce high-quality object annotations in a fully-automatic and low-cost way. Compared with the traditional human-in-the-loop solution, TagMe can produce the same amount of annotations at a much lower cost, e.g., up to 110x.\\n        \",\n",

In the Internet today, however, there is a mismatch between where queues build and where control is most effectively enforced; queues build at bottleneck links that are often not under the control of the data sender. To resolve this mismatch, we propose a new kind of middlebox, called Bundler. Bundler uses a novel inner control loop between a sendbox (in the sender's site) and a receivebox (in the receiver's site) to determine the aggregate rate for the bundle, leaving the end-to-end connections and their control loops intact. Enforcing this sending rate ensures that bottleneck queues that would have built up from the bundle's packets now shift from the bottleneck to the sendbox. The sendbox then exercises control over its traffic by scheduling packets to achieve higher-level objectives. We have implemented Bundler in Linux and evaluated it with real-world and emulation experiments. We find that Bundler allows the sender-chosen policy to be effective: when configured to implement Stochastic Fairness Queueing (SFQ), it improves median flow completion time (FCT) by between 28% and 97% across various scenarios.\\n        \",\n",

Prior solutions fall into two categories: (1) pixel-wise segmentation-based approaches, which predict whether each pixel is on a road, and (2) graph-based approaches, which predict the road graph iteratively. We find that these two approaches have complementary strengths while suffering from their own inherent limitations.\\n  In this paper, we propose a new method, Sat2Graph, which combines the advantages of the two prior categories into a unified framework. The key idea in Sat2Graph is a novel encoding scheme, graph-tensor encoding (GTE), which encodes the road graph into a tensor representation. GTE makes it possible to train a simple, non-recurrent, supervised model to predict a rich set of features that capture the graph structure directly from an image. We evaluate Sat2Graph using two large datasets. We find that Sat2Graph surpasses prior methods on two widely used metrics, TOPO and APLS. Furthermore, whereas prior work only infers planar road graphs, our approach is capable of inferring stacked roads (e.g., overpasses), and does so robustly.\\n        ',\n",

Often, due to the occlusion in satellite imagery and the spatial correlation of road attributes, a road attribute at one position on a road may only be apparent when considering far-away segments of the road. Thus, to robustly infer road attributes, the model must integrate scattered information and capture the spatial correlation of features along roads. Existing solutions that rely on image classifiers fail to capture this correlation, resulting in poor accuracy. We find this failure is caused by a fundamental limitation -- the limited effective receptive field of image classifiers. To overcome this limitation, we propose RoadTagger, an end-to-end architecture which combines both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to infer road attributes. The usage of graph neural networks allows information propagation on the road network graph and eliminates the receptive field limitation of image classifiers. We evaluate RoadTagger on both a large real-world dataset covering 688 km^2 area in 20 U.S. cities and a synthesized micro-dataset. In the evaluation, RoadTagger improves inference accuracy over the CNN image classifier based approaches. RoadTagger also demonstrates strong robustness against different disruptions in the satellite imagery and the ability to learn complicated inductive rules for aggregating scattered information along the road network.\\n        ',\n",

Editing maps today involves a tedious process of manually tracing and annotating roads, buildings, and other map features.\\n  Over the past decade, many automatic map inference systems have been proposed to automatically extract street map data from satellite imagery, aerial imagery, and GPS trajectory datasets. However, automatic map inference has failed to gain traction in practice due to two key limitations: high error rates (low precision), which manifest in noisy inference outputs, and a lack of end-to-end system design to leverage inferred data to update existing street maps.\\n  At MIT and QCRI, we have developed a number of algorithms and approaches to address these challenges, which we combined into a new system we call Mapster. Mapster is a human-in-the-loop street map editing system that incorporates three components to robustly accelerate the mapping process over traditional tools and workflows: high-precision automatic map inference, data refinement, and machine-assisted map editing.\\n  Through an evaluation on a large-scale dataset including satellite imagery, GPS trajectories, and ground-truth map data in forty cities, we show that Mapster makes automation practical for map editing, and enables the curation of map datasets that are more complete and up-to-date at less cost.\\n        ',\n",

We propose machine-assisted map editing, where automatic map inference is integrated into existing, human-centric map editing workflows. To realize this, we build Machine-Assisted iD (MAiD), where we extend the web-based OpenStreetMap editor, iD, with machine-assistance functionality. We complement MAiD with a novel approach for inferring road topology from aerial imagery that combines the speed of prior segmentation approaches with the accuracy of prior iterative graph construction methods. We design MAiD to tackle the addition of major, arterial roads in regions where existing maps have poor coverage, and the incremental improvement of coverage in regions where major roads are already mapped. We conduct two user studies and find that, when participants are given a fixed time to map roads, they are able to add as much as 3.5x more roads with MAiD.\\n        ',\n",

Many modern systems beamform with antenna arrays for this purpose. However, a radio's ability to direct its signal is fundamentally limited by its size. Unfortunately practical challenges limit the size of modern radios, and consequently, their ability to beamform. In many settings, radios on devices must be small and inexpensive; today, these settings are unable to benefit from high-precision beamforming.\\n  To address this problem, we introduce RFocus, which moves beamforming functions from the radio endpoints to the environment. RFocus includes a two-dimensional surface with a rectangular array of simple elements, each of which functions as an RF switch. Each element either lets the signal through or reflects it. The surface does not emit any power of its own. The state of the elements is set by a software controller to maximize the signal strength at a receiver, with a novel optimization algorithm that uses signal strength measurements from the receiver. The RFocus surface can be manufactured as an inexpensive thin wallpaper, requiring no wiring. This solution requires only a method to communicate received signal strengths periodically to the RFocus controller. Our prototype implementation improves the median signal strength by 10.5x, and the median channel capacity by 2.1x.\\n        \",\n",

ABC routers mark each packet with an \"accelerate\" or \"brake\", which causes senders to slightly increase or decrease their congestion windows. Routers use this feedback to quickly guide senders towards a desired target rate. ABC requires no changes to header formats or user devices, but achieves better performance than XCP. ABC is also incrementally deployable; it operates correctly when the bottleneck is a non-ABC router, and can coexist with non-ABC traffic sharing the same bottleneck link. We evaluate ABC using a Wi-Fi implementation and trace-driven emulation of cellular links. ABC achieves 30-40% higher throughput than Cubic+Codel for similar delays, and 2.2X lower delays than BBR on a Wi-Fi path. On cellular network paths, ABC achieves 50% higher throughput than Cubic+Codel.\\n        ',\n",

We commissioned a professional survey of people around theUnited States to answer several relevant questions. We found that 51% of the 876 respondents--substantially larger than our expectations--answered \"yes\" to whether they would participate for suitable financial incentives. Encouraged by the results of the survey, we propose Gringotts, a system to structure incentives and securely incorporate P2P delivery into content delivery systems.

To estimate elasticity, Nimbus modulates the flow\\'s sending rate with sinusoidal pulses that create small traffic fluctuations at the bottleneck link, and measures the frequency response of the rate of the cross traffic. Our results on emulated and real-world paths show that congestion control using elasticity detection achieves throughput comparable to Cubic, but with delays that are 50-70 ms lower when cross traffic is inelastic. Nimbus detects the nature of the cross traffic more accurately than Copa, and is usable as a building block by other end-to-end algorithms.\\n        ',\n",

Further, in many scheduling algorithms these decisions can be made when packets are enqueued. We leverage this observation to build a programmable scheduler using a single abstraction: the push-in first-out queue (PIFO), a priority queue that maintains the scheduling order and time for such algorithms.\\n  We show that a programmable scheduler using PIFOs lets us program a wide variety of scheduling algorithms. We present a detailed hardware design for this scheduler for a 64-port 10 Gbit/s shared-memory switch with <4% chip area overhead on a 16-nm standard-cell library.

The key challenge is that these algorithms create and modify algorithmic state. The key idea to achieve line-rate programmability for stateful algorithms is the notion of a packet transaction : a sequential code block that is atomic and isolated from other such code blocks. We have developed this idea in Domino, a C-like imperative language to express data-plane algorithms.

They are the first rateless codes with proofs of these properties for BSC and AWGN. The key idea in the spinal code is the sequential application of a hash function over the message bits. The sequential structure of the code turns out to be crucial for efficient decoding. Moreover, counter to the wisdom of having an expander structure in good codes, we show that the spinal code, despite its sequential structure, achieves capacity. The pseudo-randomness provided by a hash function suffices for this purpose. Our proof introduces a variant of Gallager's result characterizing the error exponent of random codes for any memoryless channel.

Here, we present a generic theoretical framework for modeling the absorption, emission and energy transfer of incoherent radiation between cascade sensitizer and laser gain media. Our model is based on linear equations of the modified net radiation method and is therefore robust, fast converging and has low complexity. We apply this formalism to compute the optimal parameters of low-threshold solar-pumped lasers. It is revealed that the interplay between the absorption and self-absorption of such lasers defines the optimal pump absorption below the maximal value, which is in contrast to conventional lasers for which full pump absorption is desired. Numerical results are compared to experimental data on a sensitized Nd:YAG cavity, and quantitative agreement with theoretical models is found.

As the number of constraints and hyper-parameter dimensions grow, naively selected settings may lead to sub-optimal and/or unreliable results. We develop an efficient method for calibrating models such that their predictions provably satisfy multiple explicit and simultaneous statistical guarantees (e.g., upper-bounded error rates), while also optimizing any number of additional, unconstrained objectives (e.g., total run-time cost). Building on recent results in distribution-free, finite-sample risk control for general losses, we propose Pareto Testing: a two-stage process which combines multi-objective optimization with multiple hypothesis testing. The optimization stage constructs a set of promising combinations on the Pareto frontier. We then apply statistical testing to this frontier only to identify configurations that have (i) high utility with respect to our objectives, and (ii) guaranteed risk levels with respect to our constraints, with specifiable high probability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to reliably accelerate the execution of large-scale Transformer models in natural language processing (NLP) applications.

Providing calibrated uncertainty estimates alongside predictions -- probabilities that correspond to true frequencies -- can be as important as having predictions that are simply accurate on average. However, uncertainty estimates can be unreliable for certain inputs. In this paper, we develop a new approach to selective classification in which we propose a method for rejecting examples with \"uncertain\" uncertainties. By doing so, we aim to make predictions with {well-calibrated} uncertainty estimates over the distribution of accepted examples, a property we call selective calibration. We present a framework for learning selectively calibrated models, where a separate selector network is trained to improve the selective calibration error of a given base model. In particular, our work focuses on achieving robust calibration, where the model is intentionally designed to be tested on out-of-domain data.

We develop SMCDiff to efficiently sample scaffolds from this distribution conditioned on a given motif; our algorithm is the first to theoretically guarantee conditional samples from a diffusion model in the large-compute limit. We evaluate our designed backbones by how well they align with AlphaFold2-predicted structures. We show that our method can (1) sample scaffolds up to 80 residues and (2) achieve structurally diverse scaffolds for a fixed motif.\\n        ',\n",

Several machine learning approaches have been developed, but none have outperformed state-of-the-art cheminformatics methods. We propose torsional diffusion, a novel diffusion framework that operates on the space of torsion angles via a diffusion process on the hypertorus and an extrinsic-to-intrinsic score model. On a standard benchmark of drug-like molecules, torsional diffusion generates superior conformer ensembles compared to machine learning and cheminformatics methods in terms of both RMSD and chemical properties, and is orders of magnitude faster than previous diffusion-based models. Moreover, our model provides exact likelihoods, which we employ to build the first generalizable Boltzmann generator.

Previous data-driven models formulate it as an image-to-sequence task, to generate a sequential representation of the molecule (e.g. SMILES string) from its graphical representation. Although they perform adequately on certain benchmarks, these models are not robust in real-world situations, where molecular images differ in style, quality, and chemical patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel graph generation approach that explicitly predicts atoms and bonds, along with their geometric layouts, to construct the molecular graph. We develop data augmentation strategies for molecules and images to increase the robustness of our model against domain shifts. Our model is flexible to incorporate chemistry constraints, and produces more interpretable predictions than SMILES. In experiments on both synthetic and realistic molecular images, our model significantly outperforms previous models, achieving 84-93% accuracy on five benchmarks. We also conduct human evaluation and show that our model reduces the time for a chemist to extract molecular structures from images by roughly 50%.\\n        ',\n",

Given a dataset with input-label pairs, ls learns to split this dataset so that predictors trained on the training split cannot generalize to the testing split. This performance gap suggests that the testing split is under-represented in the dataset, which is a signal of potential bias. Identifying non-generalizable splits is challenging since we have no annotations about the bias. In this work, we show that the prediction correctness of each example in the testing split can be used as a source of weak supervision: generalization performance will drop if we move examples that are predicted correctly away from the testing split, leaving only those that are mis-predicted. ls is task-agnostic and can be applied to any supervised learning problem, ranging from natural language understanding and image classification to molecular property prediction. Empirical results show that ls is able to generate astonishingly challenging splits that correlate with human-identified biases. Moreover, we demonstrate that combining robust learning algorithms (such as group DRO) with splits identified by ls enables automatic de-biasing. Compared to previous state-of-the-art, we substantially improve the worst-group performance (23.4% on average) when the source of biases is unknown during training and validation.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        We develop a new approach to multi-label conformal prediction in which we aim to output a precise set of promising prediction candidates with a bounded number of incorrect answers. Standard conformal prediction provides the ability to adapt to model uncertainty by constructing a calibrated candidate set in place of a single prediction, with guarantees that the set contains the correct answer with high probability. In order to obey this coverage property, however, conformal sets can become inundated with noisy candidates -- which can render them unhelpful in practice. This is particularly relevant to practical applications where there is a limited budget, and the cost (monetary or otherwise) associated with false positives is non-negligible. We propose to trade coverage for a notion of precision by enforcing that the presence of incorrect candidates in the predicted conformal sets (i.e., the total number of false positives) is bounded according to a user-specified tolerance. Subject to this constraint, our algorithm then optimizes for a generalized notion of set coverage (i.e., the true positive rate) that allows for any number of true answers for a given query (including zero). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across a number of classification tasks in natural language processing, computer vision, and computational chemistry.\\n        ',\n",

We challenge this paradigm with EquiBind, an SE(3)-equivariant geometric deep learning model performing direct-shot prediction of both i) the receptor binding location (blind docking) and ii) the ligand's bound pose and orientation. EquiBind achieves significant speed-ups and better quality compared to traditional and recent baselines. Further, we show extra improvements when coupling it with existing fine-tuning techniques at the cost of increased running time. Finally, we propose a novel and fast fine-tuning model that adjusts torsion angles of a ligand's rotatable bonds based on closed-form global minima of the von Mises angular distance to a given input atomic point cloud, avoiding previous expensive differential evolution strategies for energy minimization.\\n        \",\n",

The randomness in the encoder acts as the private key for the data owner. We quantify privacy as the number of attacker guesses required to re-identify a single image (guesswork). We propose a contrastive learning algorithm to estimate guesswork. We show empirically that differentially private methods, such as DP-Image, obtain privacy at a significant loss of utility. In contrast, Syfer achieves strong privacy while preserving utility.

We design a novel pairwise-independent SE(3)-equivariant graph matching network to predict the rotation and translation to place one of the proteins at the right docked position relative to the second protein. We mathematically guarantee a basic principle: the predicted complex is always identical regardless of the initial locations and orientations of the two structures. Our model, named EquiDock, approximates the binding pockets and predicts the docking poses using keypoint matching and alignment, achieved through optimal transport and a differentiable Kabsch algorithm.

To do so, we train a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode molecular fragments in a coherent latent space, which we then utilize as a vocabulary for editing molecules to explore the complex chemical property space. Equipped with the learned fragment vocabulary, we propose Fragment-based Sequential Translation (FaST), which learns a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to iteratively translate model-discovered molecules into increasingly novel molecules while satisfying desired properties. Empirical evaluation shows that FaST significantly improves over state-of-the-art methods on benchmark single/multi-objective molecular optimization tasks.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Generating the periodic structure of stable materials is a long-standing challenge for the material design community. This task is difficult because stable materials only exist in a low-dimensional subspace of all possible periodic arrangements of atoms: 1) the coordinates must lie in the local energy minimum defined by quantum mechanics, and 2) global stability also requires the structure to follow the complex, yet specific bonding preferences between different atom types. Existing methods fail to incorporate these factors and often lack proper invariances. We propose a Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE) that captures the physical inductive bias of material stability. By learning from the data distribution of stable materials, the decoder generates materials in a diffusion process that moves atomic coordinates towards a lower energy state and updates atom types to satisfy bonding preferences between neighbors. Our model also explicitly encodes interactions across periodic boundaries and respects permutation, translation, rotation, and periodic invariances. We significantly outperform past methods in three tasks: 1) reconstructing the input structure, 2) generating valid, diverse, and realistic materials, and 3) generating materials that optimize a specific property. We also provide several standard datasets and evaluation metrics for the broader machine learning community.\\n        ',\n",

In this paper, we propose a generative model to automatically design the CDRs of antibodies with enhanced binding specificity or neutralization capabilities. Previous generative approaches formulate protein design as a structure-conditioned sequence generation task, assuming the desired 3D structure is given a priori. In contrast, we propose to co-design the sequence and 3D structure of CDRs as graphs. Our model unravels a sequence autoregressively while iteratively refining its predicted global structure. The inferred structure in turn guides subsequent residue choices. For efficiency, we model the conditional dependence between residues inside and outside of a CDR in a coarse-grained manner.

Given only input-label pairs, algorithms may lack sufficient information to distinguish stable (causal) features from unstable (spurious) features. However, related tasks often share similar biases -- an observation we may leverage to develop stable classifiers in the transfer setting. In this work, we explicitly inform the target classifier about unstable features in the source tasks. Specifically, we derive a representation that encodes the unstable features by contrasting different data environments in the source task. We achieve robustness by clustering data of the target task according to this representation and minimizing the worst-case risk across these clusters. We evaluate our method on both text and image classifications. Empirical results demonstrate that our algorithm is able to maintain robustness on the target task for both synthetically generated environments and real-world environments.

Leveraging the power of message passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture local and global graph information, we predict local atomic 3D structures and torsion angles, avoiding unnecessary over-parameterization of the geometric degrees of freedom (e.g. one angle per non-terminal bond). Such local predictions suffice both for the training loss computation, as well as for the full deterministic conformer assembly (at test time). We devise a non-adversarial optimal transport based loss function to promote diverse conformer generation. GeoMol predominantly outperforms popular open-source, commercial, or state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models, while achieving significant speed-ups.

We propose NeuraCrypt, a private encoding scheme based on random deep neural networks. NeuraCrypt encodes raw patient data using a randomly constructed neural network known only to the data-owner, and publishes both the encoded data and associated labels publicly. From a theoretical perspective, we demonstrate that sampling from a sufficiently rich family of encoding functions offers a well-defined and meaningful notion of privacy against a computationally unbounded adversary with full knowledge of the underlying data-distribution. We propose to approximate this family of encoding functions through random deep neural networks. Empirically, we demonstrate the robustness of our encoding to a suite of adversarial attacks and show that NeuraCrypt achieves competitive accuracy to non-private baselines on a variety of x-ray tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that multiple hospitals, using independent private encoders, can collaborate to train improved x-ray models. Finally, we release a challenge dataset to encourage the development of new attacks on NeuraCrypt.\\n        ',\n",

In this work, we prove that by interpolating the distributions of the correct predictions and the wrong predictions, we can uncover an oracle distribution where the unstable correlation vanishes. Since the oracle interpolation coefficients are not accessible, we use group distributionally robust optimization to minimize the worst-case risk across all such interpolations.

Additional targets are iteratively produced and used in the course of stochastic EM iterations to maximize the log-likelihood that the candidate structures are accepted. A simple rejection (re-weighting) sampler suffices to draw posterior samples since the generative model is already reasonable after pre-training.

The blanks control which part of the sequence to expand, making BLM ideal for a variety of text editing and rewriting tasks. The model can start from a single blank or partially completed text with blanks at specified locations. It iteratively determines which word to place in a blank and whether to insert new blanks, and stops generating when no blanks are left to fill. BLM can be efficiently trained using a lower bound of the marginal data likelihood. On the task of filling missing text snippets, BLM significantly outperforms all other baselines in terms of both accuracy and fluency. Experiments on style transfer and damaged ancient text restoration demonstrate the potential of this framework for a wide range of applications.\\n        ',\n",

While questions are often asked with respect to long documents, there are many challenges with modeling such long documents. Many existing techniques generate questions by effectively looking at one sentence at a time, leading to questions that are easy and not reflective of the human process of question generation. Our goal is to incorporate interactions across multiple sentences to generate realistic questions for long documents. In order to link a broad document context to the target answer, we represent the relevant context via a multi-stage attention mechanism, which forms the foundation of a sequence to sequence model.

To this end, we propose a two-step solution: (1) We identify and remove the contradicting components in a target text for a given claim, using a neutralizing stance model; (2) We expand the remaining text to be consistent with the given claim, using a novel two-encoder sequence-to-sequence model with copy attention. Applied to a Wikipedia fact update dataset, our method successfully generates updated sentences for new claims, achieving the highest SARI score.

In light of these concerns, several studies have proposed to detect machine-generated fake news by capturing their stylistic differences from human-written text. These approaches, broadly termed stylometry, have found success in source attribution and misinformation detection in human-written texts. However, in this work, we show that stylometry is limited against machine-generated misinformation. While humans speak differently when trying to deceive, LMs generate stylistically consistent text, regardless of underlying motive. Thus, though stylometry can successfully prevent impersonation by identifying text provenance, it fails to distinguish legitimate LM applications from those that introduce false information. We create two benchmarks demonstrating the stylistic similarity between malicious and legitimate uses of LMs, employed in auto-completion and editing-assistance settings. Our findings highlight the need for non-stylometry approaches in detecting machine-generated misinformation, and open up the discussion on the desired evaluation benchmarks.\\n        ',\n",

Meta-learning has shown strong performance in computer vision, where low-level patterns are transferable across learning tasks. However, directly applying this approach to text is challenging--lexical features highly informative for one task may be insignificant for another. Thus, rather than learning solely from words, our model also leverages their distributional signatures, which encode pertinent word occurrence patterns. Our model is trained within a meta-learning framework to map these signatures into attention scores, which are then used to weight the lexical representations of words. We demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms prototypical networks learned on lexical knowledge (Snell et al., 2017) in both few-shot text classification and relation classification by a significant margin across six benchmark datasets (20.0% on average in 1-shot classification).\\n        ',\n",

In this paper, we consider the case where future increases in cluster size will cause the global batch size that can be used to train models to reach a fundamental limit: beyond a certain point, larger global batch sizes cause sample efficiency to degrade, increasing overall time to accuracy. As a result, to achieve further improvements in training performance, we must instead consider \"strong scaling\" strategies that hold the global batch size constant and allocate smaller batches to each GPU. Unfortunately, this makes it significantly more difficult to use cluster resources efficiently. We present DeepPool, a system that addresses this efficiency challenge through two key ideas. First, burst parallelism allocates large numbers of GPUs to foreground jobs in bursts to exploit the unevenness in parallelism across layers. Second, GPU multiplexing prioritizes throughput for foreground training jobs, while packing in background training jobs to reclaim underutilized GPU resources, thereby improving cluster-wide utilization. Together, these two ideas enable DeepPool to deliver a 1.2 - 2.3x improvement in total cluster throughput over standard data parallelism with a single task when the cluster scale is large.\\n        ',\n",

This includes the maximum count rate, latency, jitter, and quantum efficiency. Despite its importance, the study of TBC in superconducting nanowire devices has not been done systematically, primarily due to the lack of a straightforward characterization method.

This device takes advantage of the multiplexing capability of the KID, allowing for a natural frequency multiplexed readout. The Kinetic Inductance Magnetometer (KIM) is biased with a DC magnetic flux through the inductive loop. A perturbing signal will cause a flux change through the loop, and thus a change in the induced current, which alters the kinetic inductance of the nanowires, causing the resonant frequency of the KIM to shift.

One limitation of the technique is, however, that the composition of overlapping tissue needs to be interpolated from a region surrounding the lesion. The purpose of this investigation was to demonstrate that lesion characterization can be done with spectral tomosynthesis, and to investigate whether the 3D information available in tomosynthesis can reduce the uncertainty from the interpolation of surrounding tissue. A phantom experiment was designed to simulate a cyst and a tumor, where the tumor was overlaid with a structure that made it mimic a cyst. In 2D, the two targets appeared similar in composition, whereas spectral tomosynthesis revealed the exact compositional difference. However, the loss of discrimination signal due to spread from the plane of interest was of the same strength as the reduction of anatomical noise. Results from a preliminary investigation on clinical tomosynthesis images of solid lesions yielded results that were consistent with the phantom experiments, but were still to some extent inconclusive. We conclude that lesion characterization is feasible in spectral tomosynthesis, but more data, as well as refinement of the calibration and discrimination algorithms, are needed to draw final conclusions about the benefit compared to 2D.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Spectral imaging is the acquisition of multiple images of an object at different energy spectra. In mammography, dual-energy imaging (spectral imaging with two energy levels) has been investigated for several applications, in particular material decomposition, which allows for quantitative analysis of breast composition and quantitative contrast-enhanced imaging. Material decomposition with dual-energy imaging is based on the assumption that there are two dominant photon interaction effects that determine linear attenuation: the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering. This assumption limits the number of basis materials, i.e. the number of materials that are possible to differentiate between, to two. However, Rayleigh scattering may account for more than 10% of the linear attenuation in the mammography energy range. In this work, we show that a modified version of a scanning multi-slit spectral photon-counting mammography system is able to acquire three images at different spectra and can be used for triple-energy imaging. We further show that triple-energy imaging in combination with the efficient scatter rejection of the system enables measurement of Rayleigh scattering, which adds an additional energy dependency to the linear attenuation and enables material decomposition with three basis materials. Three available basis materials have the potential to improve virtually all applications of spectral imaging.\\n        ',\n",

The purpose of the present study is to evaluate a method for measuring the volumetric breast density using photon-counting spectral tomosynthesis. The performance of the method was evaluated using phantom measurements and clinical data from a small population (n=18). The precision was determined to 2.4 percentage points (pp) of volumetric breast density. Strong correlations were observed between contralateral (R^2=0.95) and ipsilateral (R^2=0.96) breast-density measurements. The measured breast density was anti-correlated to breast thickness, as expected, and exhibited a skewed distribution in the range [3.7%, 55%] and with a median of 18%.

Specifically, we are interested in adapting to fluctuations of actual demand conditions in urban environments, such as on-peak vs. off-peak hours. We achieve this through a combination of (i) online play, a lookahead optimization method that improves the performance of rollout methods via an approximate policy iteration step, and (ii) an offline approximation scheme that allows for adapting to changes in the underlying demand model. In particular, we achieve adaptivity of our learned policy to different demand distributions by quantifying a region of validity using the q-valid radius of a Wasserstein Ambiguity Set. We propose a mechanism for switching the originally trained offline approximation when the current demand is outside the original validity region. In this case, we propose to use an offline architecture, trained on a historical demand model that is closer to the current demand in terms of Wasserstein distance. We learn routing and pickup policies over real taxicab requests in downtown San Francisco with high variability between on-peak and off-peak hours, demonstrating the ability of our method to adapt to real fluctuation in demand distributions.

Our methods specifically address the computational challenges of partially observable multiagent problems. In particular: 1) We consider rollout algorithms that dramatically reduce required computation while preserving the key cost improvement property of the standard rollout method. The per-step computational requirements for our methods are on the order of $O(Cm)$ as compared with $O(C^m)$ for standard rollout, where $C$ is the maximum cardinality of the constraint set for the control component of each agent, and $m$ is the number of agents. 2) We show that our methods can be applied to challenging problems with a graph structure, including a class of robot repair problems whereby multiple robots collaboratively inspect and repair a system under partial information. 3) We provide a simulation study that compares our methods with existing methods, and demonstrate that our methods can handle larger and more complex partially observable multiagent problems (state space size $10^{37}$ and control space size $10^{7}$, respectively). Finally, we incorporate our multiagent rollout algorithms as building blocks in an approximate policy iteration scheme, where successive rollout policies are approximated by using neural network classifiers.

This algorithm is also used for policy improvement in an approximate policy iteration scheme, where successive policies are approximated by using a neural network classifier. A novel feature of our approach is that it is well suited for distributed computation through an extended belief space formulation and the use of a partitioned architecture, which is trained with multiple neural networks. We apply our methods in simulation to a class of sequential repair problems where a robot inspects and repairs a pipeline with potentially several rupture sites under partial information about the state of the pipeline.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        We propose a new aggregation framework for approximate dynamic programming, which provides a connection with rollout algorithms, approximate policy iteration, and other single and multistep lookahead methods. The central novel characteristic is the use of a bias function $V$ of the state, which biases the values of the aggregate cost function towards their correct levels. The classical aggregation framework is obtained when $V\\\\equiv0$, but our scheme works best when $V$ is a known reasonably good approximation to the optimal cost function $J^*$.\\n  When $V$ is equal to the cost function $J_Œº$ of some known policy $Œº$ and there is only one aggregate state, our scheme is equivalent to the rollout algorithm based on $Œº$ (i.e., the result of a single policy improvement starting with the policy $Œº$). When $V=J_Œº$ and there are multiple aggregate states, our aggregation approach can be used as a more powerful form of improvement of $Œº$. Thus, when combined with an approximate policy evaluation scheme, our approach can form the basis for a new and enhanced form of approximate policy iteration.\\n  When $V$ is a generic bias function, our scheme is equivalent to approximation in value space with lookahead function equal to $V$ plus a local correction within each aggregate state. The local correction levels are obtained by solving a low-dimensional aggregate DP problem, yielding an arbitrarily close approximation to $J^*$, when the number of aggregate states is sufficiently large. Except for the bias function, the aggregate DP problem is similar to the one of the classical aggregation framework, and its algorithmic solution by simulation or other methods is nearly identical to one for classical aggregation, assuming values of $V$ are available when needed.\\n        ',\n",
       " \"\\n        We consider finite and infinite horizon dynamic programming problems, where the control at each stage consists of several distinct decisions, each one made by one of several agents. We introduce an approach, whereby at every stage, each agent's decision is made by executing a local rollout algorithm that uses a base policy, together with some coordinating information from the other agents. The amount of local computation required at every stage by each agent is independent of the number of agents, while the amount of total computation (over all agents) grows linearly with the number of agents. By contrast, with the standard rollout algorithm, the amount of total computation grows exponentially with the number of agents. Despite the drastic reduction in required computation, we show that our algorithm has the fundamental cost improvement property of rollout: an improved performance relative to the base policy. We also discuss possibilities to improve further the method's computational efficiency through limited agent coordination and parallelization of the agents' computations. Finally, we explore related approximate policy iteration algorithms for infinite horizon problems, and we prove that the cost improvement property steers the algorithm towards convergence to an agent-by-agent optimal policy.\\n        \",\n",

We discuss properties and possible implementations of this type of aggregation, including a new approach to approximate policy iteration. In this approach the policy improvement operation combines feature-based aggregation with feature construction using deep neural networks or other calculations.

Another benefit is the potential integration into the proximal algorithmic context of several new ideas that have emerged in the DP/RL context. We discuss some of the possibilities, and in particular, algorithms that project each proximal iterate onto the subspace spanned by a small number of basis functions, using low-dimensional calculations and simulation. A third benefit is that insights and analysis from proximal algorithms can be brought to bear on the enhancement of TD methods.\\n  The linear fixed point methodology can be extended to nonlinear fixed point problems involving a contraction, thus providing guaranteed and potentially substantial acceleration of the proximal and forward backward splitting algorithms at no extra cost. Moreover, the connection of proximal and TD methods can be extended to nonlinear (nondifferentiable) fixed point problems through new proximal-like algorithms that involve successive linearization, similar to policy iteration in DP.\\n        ',\n",

For DRL settings, this leads to a novel empirical adversarial attack to RL agents via a learned adversary that is much stronger than previous ones. To enhance the robustness of an agent, we propose a framework of alternating training with learned adversaries (ATLA), which trains an adversary online together with the agent using policy gradient following the optimal adversarial attack framework.

Existing approaches find the minimal adversarial perturbation by a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which takes exponential time so is impractical for large ensembles. Although this verification problem is NP-complete in general, we give a more precise complexity characterization. We show that there is a simple linear time algorithm for verifying a single tree, and for tree ensembles, the verification problem can be cast as a max-clique problem on a multi-partite graph with bounded boxicity. For low dimensional problems when boxicity can be viewed as constant, this reformulation leads to a polynomial time algorithm.

Test examples that are relatively far away from this manifold are more likely to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Consequentially, an adversarial training based defense is susceptible to a new class of attacks, the \"blind-spot attack\", where the input images reside in \"blind-spots\" (low density regions) of the empirical distribution of training data but is still on the ground-truth data manifold. For MNIST, we found that these blind-spots can be easily found by simply scaling and shifting image pixel values. Most importantly, for large datasets with high dimensional and complex data manifold (CIFAR, ImageNet, etc), the existence of blind-spots in adversarial training makes defending on any valid test examples difficult due to the curse of dimensionality and the scarcity of training data. Additionally, we find that blind-spots also exist on provable defenses including (Wong & Kolter, 2018) and (Sinha et al., 2018) because these trainable robustness certificates can only be practically optimized on a limited set of training data.\\n        ',\n",

       " '\\n        This paper identifies a structural property of data distributions that enables deep neural networks to learn hierarchically. We define the \"staircase\" property for functions over the Boolean hypercube, which posits that high-order Fourier coefficients are reachable from lower-order Fourier coefficients along increasing chains. We prove that functions satisfying this property can be learned in polynomial time using layerwise stochastic coordinate descent on regular neural networks -- a class of network architectures and initializations that have homogeneity properties. Our analysis shows that for such staircase functions and neural networks, the gradient-based algorithm learns high-level features by greedily combining lower-level features along the depth of the network. We further back our theoretical results with experiments showing that staircase functions are also learnable by more standard ResNet architectures with stochastic gradient descent. Both the theoretical and experimental results support the fact that staircase properties have a role to play in understanding the capabilities of gradient-based learning on regular networks, in contrast to general polynomial-size networks that can emulate any SQ or PAC algorithms as recently shown.\\n        ',\n",

Concretely, we aim to learn a model such that posteriors $P(X_i|X_S)$ for small sets of variables $S$ are accurate. Since its introduction more than 50 years ago, the Chow-Liu algorithm, which efficiently computes the maximum likelihood tree, has been the benchmark algorithm for learning tree-structured graphical models. A bound on the sample complexity of the Chow-Liu algorithm with respect to the prediction-centric local total variation loss was shown in [BK19]. While those results demonstrated that it is possible to learn a useful model even when recovering the true underlying graph is impossible, their bound depends on the maximum strength of interactions and thus does not achieve the information-theoretic optimum. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm that carefully combines elements of the Chow-Liu algorithm with tree metric reconstruction methods to efficiently and optimally learn tree Ising models under a prediction-centric loss. Our algorithm is robust to model misspecification and adversarial corruptions. In contrast, we show that the celebrated Chow-Liu algorithm can be arbitrarily suboptimal.\\n        ',\n",

In this paper we aim to identify the precise threshold for $d$ in terms of $n$ for subsets of Wishart matrices to converge in total variation to independent Gaussians. It turns out that the combinatorial structure of the revealed entries, viewed as the adjacency matrix of a graph $G$, characterizes the distance from fully independent. Specifically, we show that the threshold for $d$ depends on the number of various small subgraphs in $G$. So, even when the number of revealed entries is fixed, the threshold can vary wildly depending on their configuration. Convergence of masked Wishart to independent Gaussians thus inherently involves an interplay between both probabilistic and combinatorial phenomena. Our results determine the sharp threshold for a large family of $G$, including Erd≈ës-R√©nyi $G\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{G}(n,p)$ at all values $p\\\\gtrsim n^{-2}\\\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$.

A prominent approach is to characterize the limits of restricted models of computation, which on the one hand yields strong computational lower bounds for powerful classes of algorithms and on the other hand helps guide the development of efficient algorithms. In this paper, we study two of the most popular restricted computational models, the statistical query framework and low-degree polynomials, in the context of high-dimensional hypothesis testing. Our main result is that under mild conditions on the testing problem, the two classes of algorithms are essentially equivalent in power.

Our results establish that in general, optimization with Markovian data is strictly harder than optimization with independent data and a trivial algorithm (SGD-DD) that works with only one in every $\\\\tildeŒò(œÑ_{\\\\mathsf{mix}})$ samples, which are approximately independent, is minimax optimal. In fact, it is strictly better than the popular Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method with constant step-size which is otherwise minimax optimal in the regression with independent data setting.\\n  Beyond a worst case analysis, we investigate whether structured datasets seen in practice such as Gaussian auto-regressive dynamics can admit more efficient optimization schemes. Surprisingly, even in this specific and natural setting, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with constant step-size is still no better than SGD-DD. Instead, we propose an algorithm based on experience replay--a popular reinforcement learning technique--that achieves a significantly better error rate. Our improved rate serves as one of the first results where an algorithm outperforms SGD-DD on an interesting Markov chain and also provides one of the first theoretical analyses to support the use of experience replay in practice.\\n        ',\n",

The best algorithms for this task currently have time complexity $\\\\tilde{O}(n^2)$ for ferromagnetic RBMs (i.e., with attractive potentials) but $\\\\tilde{O}(n^d)$ for general RBMs, where $n$ is the number of observed variables and $d$ is the maximum degree of a latent variable.

This is an improvement when $s < \\\\log_2 (d-1)$, which corresponds to RBMs with sparse latent variables. Furthermore, we give a version of this learning algorithm that recovers a model with small prediction error and whose sample complexity is independent of the minimum potential in the Markov Random Field of the observed variables.

In the latter case similar rates can be obtained with a single nonlinear layer. Our results confirm the prevailing hypothesis that deeper networks are better at representing less smooth functions, and indeed, the main technical novelty is to fully exploit the fact that deep networks can produce highly oscillatory functions with few activation functions.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Inference problems with conjectured statistical-computational gaps are ubiquitous throughout modern statistics, computer science and statistical physics. While there has been success evidencing these gaps from the failure of restricted classes of algorithms, progress towards a more traditional reduction-based approach to computational complexity in statistical inference has been limited. Existing reductions have largely been limited to inference problems with similar structure -- primarily mapping among problems representable as a sparse submatrix signal plus a noise matrix, which are similar to the common hardness assumption of planted clique.\\n  The insight in this work is that a slight generalization of the planted clique conjecture -- secret leakage planted clique -- gives rise to a variety of new average-case reduction techniques, yielding a web of reductions among problems with very different structure. Using variants of the planted clique conjecture for specific forms of secret leakage planted clique, we deduce tight statistical-computational tradeoffs for a diverse range of problems including robust sparse mean estimation, mixtures of sparse linear regressions, robust sparse linear regression, tensor PCA, variants of dense $k$-block stochastic block models, negatively correlated sparse PCA, semirandom planted dense subgraph, detection in hidden partition models and a universality principle for learning sparse mixtures. In particular, a $k$-partite hypergraph variant of the planted clique conjecture is sufficient to establish all of our computational lower bounds. Our techniques also reveal novel connections to combinatorial designs and to random matrix theory. This work gives the first evidence that an expanded set of hardness assumptions, such as for secret leakage planted clique, may be a key first step towards a more complete theory of reductions among statistical problems.\\n        ',\n",

This technique yields several new representation and learning results for neural networks. First, we show that two-layer neural networks in the random features regime (RF) can memorize arbitrary labels for arbitrary points under under Euclidean distance separation condition using $\\\\tilde{O}(n)$ ReLUs which is optimal in $n$ up to logarithmic factors. Next, we give a powerful representation result for two-layer neural networks with ReLUs and smoothed ReLUs which can achieve a squared error of at most $Œµ$ with $O(C(a,d)Œµ^{-1/(a+1)})$ for $a \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\cup\\\\{0\\\\}$ when the function is smooth enough (roughly when it has $Œò(ad)$ bounded derivatives). In certain cases $d$ can be replaced with effective dimension $q \\\\ll d$. Previous results of this type implement Taylor series approximation using deep architectures.

We assume the planted clique conjecture for a version of the planted clique problem where the position of the planted clique is mildly constrained, and from this obtain the following computational lower bounds: (1) a $k$-to-$k^2$ statistical-computational gap for robust sparse mean estimation, providing the first average-case evidence for a conjecture of Li (2017) and Balakrishnan et al.

All previous reductions to sparse PCA either fail to show tight computational lower bounds matching existing algorithms or show lower bounds for formulations of sparse PCA other than its canonical generative model, the spiked covariance model. Also, these lower bounds all quickly degrade with the exponent in the PC conjecture. Specifically, when only given the PC conjecture up to $K = o(N^Œ±)$ where $Œ±< 1/2$, there is no sparsity level $k$ at which these lower bounds remain tight. If $Œ±\\\\le 1/3$ these reductions fail to even show the existence of a statistical-computational tradeoff at any sparsity $k$. We give a reduction from PC that yields the first full characterization of the computational barrier in the spiked covariance model, providing tight lower bounds at all sparsities $k$. We also show the surprising result that weaker forms of the PC conjecture up to clique size $K = o(N^Œ±)$ for any given $Œ±\\\\in (0, 1/2]$ imply tight computational lower bounds for sparse PCA at sparsities $k = o(n^{Œ±/3})$. This shows that even a mild improvement in the signal strength needed by the best known polynomial-time sparse PCA algorithms would imply that the hardness threshold for PC is subpolynomial.

Here we study Restricted Boltzmann Machines (or RBMs), which are a popular model with wide-ranging applications in dimensionality reduction, collaborative filtering, topic modeling, feature extraction and deep learning.\\n  The main message of our paper is a strong dichotomy in the feasibility of learning RBMs, depending on the nature of the interactions between variables: ferromagnetic models can be learned efficiently, while general models cannot. In particular, we give a simple greedy algorithm based on influence maximization to learn ferromagnetic RBMs with bounded degree. In fact, we learn a description of the distribution on the observed variables as a Markov Random Field. Our analysis is based on tools from mathematical physics that were developed to show the concavity of magnetization. Our algorithm extends straighforwardly to general ferromagnetic Ising models with latent variables.\\n  Conversely, we show that even for a contant number of latent variables with constant degree, without ferromagneticity the problem is as hard as sparse parity with noise. This hardness result is based on a sharp and surprising characterization of the representational power of bounded degree RBMs: the distribution on their observed variables can simulate any bounded order MRF. This result is of independent interest since RBMs are the building blocks of deep belief networks.\\n        ',\n",

By aggregating information at a global scale, our test works even at very high temperatures.\\n  The proofs are based on distributional approximation and sharp concentration of quadratic forms, when restricted to Hamming spheres. The restriction to Hamming spheres is necessary, since otherwise any scalar statistic is useless without explicit knowledge of the temperature parameter. At the same time, this restriction radically changes the behavior of the functions under consideration, resulting in a much smaller variance than in the independent setting; this makes it hard to directly apply standard methods (i.e., Stein's method) for concentration of weakly dependent variables.

Concretely, we show that $d$-regular Ramanujan graphs approximate the $k$th order moments of the Curie-Weiss model to within average error $k/\\\\sqrt{d}$ (averaged over the size $k$ subsets). The result applies even in the low-temperature regime; we also derive some simpler approximation results for functionals of Ising models that hold only at high enough temperatures.\\n        \",\n",
       " \"\\n        We consider an online model for recommendation systems, with each user being recommended an item at each time-step and providing 'like' or 'dislike' feedback. Each user may be recommended a given item at most once. A latent variable model specifies the user preferences: both users and items are clustered into types. All users of a given type have identical preferences for the items, and similarly, items of a given type are either all liked or all disliked by a given user. We assume that the matrix encoding the preferences of each user type for each item type is randomly generated; in this way, the model captures structure in both the item and user spaces, the amount of structure depending on the number of each of the types. The measure of performance of the recommendation system is the expected number of disliked recommendations per user, defined as expected regret. We propose two algorithms inspired by user-user and item-item collaborative filtering (CF), modified to explicitly make exploratory recommendations, and prove performance guarantees in terms of their expected regret. For two regimes of model parameters, with structure only in item space or only in user space, we prove information-theoretic lower bounds on regret that match our upper bounds up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis elucidates system operating regimes in which existing CF algorithms are nearly optimal.\\n        \",\n",

The prediction task considered in this paper is that of predicting the values of a subset of variables given values of some other subset of variables. Virtually all previous work on graphical model learning has focused on recovering the true underlying graph. We define a distance (\"small set TV\" or ssTV) between distributions $P$ and $Q$ by taking the maximum, over all subsets $\\\\mathcal{S}$ of a given size, of the total variation between the marginals of $P$ and $Q$ on $\\\\mathcal{S}$; this distance captures the accuracy of the prediction task of interest. We derive non-asymptotic bounds on the number of samples needed to get a distribution (from the same class) with small ssTV relative to the one generating the samples. One of the main messages of this paper is that far fewer samples are needed than for recovering the underlying tree, which means that accurate predictions are possible using the wrong tree.\\n        ',\n",

Motivated to understand this, we provide a framework to design and analyze various recommendation algorithms. The setup amounts to online binary matrix completion, where at each time a random user requests a recommendation and the algorithm chooses an entry to reveal in the user\\'s row. The goal is to minimize regret, or equivalently to maximize the number of +1 entries revealed at any time. We analyze an item-item collaborative filtering algorithm that can achieve fundamentally better performance compared to user-user collaborative filtering.

We first observe that the notoriously difficult problem of learning parities with noise can be captured as a special case of learning graphical models. This leads to an unconditional computational lower bound of $Œ©(p^{d/2})$ for learning general graphical models on $p$ nodes of maximum degree $d$, for the class of so-called statistical algorithms recently introduced by Feldman et al (2013). The lower bound suggests that the $O(p^d)$ runtime required to exhaustively search over neighborhoods cannot be significantly improved without restricting the class of models.\\n  Aside from structural assumptions on the graph such as it being a tree, hypertree, tree-like, etc., many recent papers on structure learning assume that the model has the correlation decay property. Indeed, focusing on ferromagnetic Ising models, Bento and Montanari (2009) showed that all known low-complexity algorithms fail to learn simple graphs when the interaction strength exceeds a number related to the correlation decay threshold. Our second set of results gives a class of repelling (antiferromagnetic) models that have the opposite behavior: very strong interaction allows efficient learning in time $O(p^2)$. We provide an algorithm whose performance interpolates between $O(p^2)$ and $O(p^{d+2})$ depending on the strength of the repulsion.\\n        ',\n",

We address this theoretical gap by introducing a model for online recommendation systems, cast item recommendation under the model as a learning problem, and analyze the performance of a cosine-similarity collaborative filtering method. In our model, each of $n$ users either likes or dislikes each of $m$ items. We assume there to be $k$ types of users, and all the users of a given type share a common string of probabilities determining the chance of liking each item. At each time step, we recommend an item to each user, where a key distinction from related bandit literature is that once a user consumes an item (e.g., watches a movie), then that item cannot be recommended to the same user again. The goal is to maximize the number of likable items recommended to users over time. Our main result establishes that after nearly $\\\\log(km)$ initial learning time steps, a simple collaborative filtering algorithm achieves essentially optimal performance without knowing $k$. The algorithm has an exploitation step that uses cosine similarity and two types of exploration steps, one to explore the space of items (standard in the literature) and the other to explore similarity between users (novel to this work).\\n        ',\n",

Over the last fifteen years this problem has been of significant interest in the statistics, machine learning, and statistical physics communities, and much of the effort has been directed towards finding algorithms with low computational cost for various restricted classes of models. Nevertheless, for learning Ising models on general graphs with $p$ nodes of degree at most $d$, it is not known whether or not it is possible to improve upon the $p^{d}$ computation needed to exhaustively search over all possible neighborhoods for each node.\\n  In this paper we show that a simple greedy procedure allows to learn the structure of an Ising model on an arbitrary bounded-degree graph in time on the order of $p^2$. We make no assumptions on the parameters except what is necessary for identifiability of the model, and in particular the results hold at low-temperatures as well as for highly non-uniform models. The proof rests on a new structural property of Ising models: we show that for any node there exists at least one neighbor with which it has a high mutual information. This structural property may be of independent interest.\\n        ',\n",

Additionally, the Glauber dynamics is a natural dynamical model in a variety of settings. This work deviates from the standard formulation of graphical model learning in the literature, where one assumes access to i.i.d. samples from the distribution.\\n  Much of the research on graphical model learning has been directed towards finding algorithms with low computational cost. As the main result of this work, we establish that the problem of reconstructing binary pairwise graphical models is computationally tractable when we observe the Glauber dynamics. Specifically, we show that a binary pairwise graphical model on $p$ nodes with maximum degree $d$ can be learned in time $f(d)p^2\\\\log p$, for a function $f(d)$, using nearly the information-theoretic minimum number of samples.\\n        ',\n",

The goal of this paper is to investigate the computational feasibility of this statistical task. Our main result shows that parameter estimation is in general intractable: no algorithm can learn the canonical parameters of a generic pair-wise binary graphical model from the mean parameters in time bounded by a polynomial in the number of variables (unless RP = NP). Indeed, such a result has been believed to be true (see the monograph by Wainwright and Jordan (2008)) but no proof was known.\\n  Our proof gives a polynomial time reduction from approximating the partition function of the hard-core model, known to be hard, to learning approximate parameters. Our reduction entails showing that the marginal polytope boundary has an inherent repulsive property, which validates an optimization procedure over the polytope that does not use any knowledge of its structure (as required by the ellipsoid method and others).\\n        ',\n",

Shotgun sequencing is the dominant technique used: many randomly located short fragments called reads are extracted from the DNA sequence, and these reads are assembled to reconstruct the original sequence. A basic question is: given a sequencing technology and the statistics of the DNA sequence, what is the minimum number of reads required for reliable reconstruction? This number provides a fundamental limit to the performance of {\\\\em any} assembly algorithm. For a simple statistical model of the DNA sequence and the read process, we show that the answer admits a critical phenomena in the asymptotic limit of long DNA sequences: if the read length is below a threshold, reconstruction is impossible no matter how many reads are observed, and if the read length is above the threshold, having enough reads to cover the DNA sequence is sufficient to reconstruct. The threshold is computed in terms of the Renyi entropy rate of the DNA sequence. We also study the impact of noise in the read process on the performance.\\n        ',\n",

The analogous result holds with M and N switched if M >= N.\\n  It turns out that, just as for the 3-user parallel interference channel \\\\cite{BT09}, the length of alignment paths captures the essence of the problem. In fact, for each feasible value of M and N the maximum alignment path length dictates both the converse and achievability arguments.\\n  One of the implications of our feasibility criterion is that simply counting equations and comparing to the number of variables does not predict feasibility. Instead, a more careful investigation of the geometry of the alignment problem is required. The necessary condition obtained by counting equations is implied by our new feasibility criterion.\\n        ',\n",

This model seeks to incorporate in random graphs the notion of reciprocity, that is, the larger than expected number of triangles and other small subgraphs. Sampling from these distributions is crucial for parameter estimation hypothesis testing, and more generally for understanding basic features of the network model itself. In practice sampling is typically carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo, in particular either the Glauber dynamics or the Metropolis-Hasting procedure.\\n  In this paper we characterize the high and low temperature regimes of the exponential random graph model. We establish that in the high temperature regime the mixing time of the Glauber dynamics is $Œò(n^2 \\\\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph; in contrast, we show that in the low temperature regime the mixing is exponentially slow for any local Markov chain. Our results, moreover, give a rigorous basis for criticisms made of such models. In the high temperature regime, where sampling with MCMC is possible, we show that any finite collection of edges are asymptotically independent; thus, the model does not possess the desired reciprocity property, and is not appreciably different from the Erd≈ës-R√©nyi random graph.\\n        ',\n",

In cases where the measure on the graph has correlation decay, the running time is $O(n^2 \\\\log n)$ for all fixed $d$. We also discuss the effect of observing noisy samples and show that as long as the noise level is low, our algorithm is effective.

Since we expect current dynamics to be smooth but highly non-linear, Gaussian processes (GPs) offer an attractive model. But we show that applying a GP with a standard stationary kernel directly to buoy data can struggle at both current prediction and divergence identification -- due to some physically unrealistic prior assumptions. To better reflect known physical properties of currents, we propose to instead put a standard stationary kernel on the divergence and curl-free components of a vector field obtained through a Helmholtz decomposition. We show that, because this decomposition relates to the original vector field just via mixed partial derivatives, we can still perform inference given the original data with only a small constant multiple of additional computational expense.

Likewise, the Laplace approximation is not equipped with non-asymptotic quality guarantees for the vast classes of posteriors for which it is asymptotically valid. To understand its quality and real-problem applicability, we need finite-sample bounds that can be computed for a given model and data set. And to understand the quality of posterior mean and variance estimates, we need bounds on divergences alternative to the TV distance. Our work provides the first closed-form, finite-sample bounds for the quality of the Laplace approximation that do not require log concavity of the posterior or an exponential-family likelihood. We bound not only the TV distance but also (A) the Wasserstein-1 distance, which controls error in a posterior mean estimate, and (B) an integral probability metric that controls the error in a posterior variance estimate.

While past results suggest that Nomon may be faster and easier to use than row-column scanning, no work has yet quantified performance of the two methods over longer time periods or in tasks beyond writing. In this paper, we also develop and validate a webcam-based switch that allows a user without a motor impairment to approximate the response times of a motor-impaired single switch user; although the approximation is not a replacement for testing with single-switch users, it allows us to better initialize, calibrate, and evaluate our method. Over 10 sessions with the webcam switch, we found users typed faster and more easily with Nomon than with row-column scanning.

In MCMC samplers of continuous random variables, Markov chain couplings can overcome bias. But these approaches depend crucially on paired chains meetings after a small number of transitions. We show that straightforward applications of existing coupling ideas to discrete clustering variables fail to meet quickly. This failure arises from the \"label-switching problem\": semantically equivalent cluster relabelings impede fast meeting of coupled chains. We instead consider chains as exploring the space of partitions rather than partitions\\' (arbitrary) labelings. Using a metric on the partition space, we formulate a practical algorithm using optimal transport couplings. Our theory confirms our method is accurate and efficient.

A recent line of research promises to show that the optimum of the CV loss matches the optimum of the out-of-sample loss (possibly after simple corrections). It remains to show how tractable it is to minimize the CV loss. In the present paper, we show that, in the case of ridge regression, the CV loss may fail to be quasiconvex and thus may have multiple local optima. We can guarantee that the CV loss is quasiconvex in at least one case: when the spectrum of the covariate matrix is nearly flat and the noise in the observed responses is not too high. More generally, we show that quasiconvexity status is independent of many properties of the observed data (response norm, covariate-matrix right singular vectors and singular-value scaling) and has a complex dependence on the few that remain.

For instance, in statistical genetics, we might regress dozens of traits (defining datasets) for thousands of individuals (responses) on up to millions of genetic variants (covariates). When an analyst has more covariates than datasets, we argue that it is often more natural to instead model effects as (1) exchangeable across covariates and (2) correlated to differing degrees across datasets. To this end, we propose a hierarchical model expressing our alternative perspective. We devise an empirical Bayes estimator for learning the degree of correlation between datasets.

Moreover, these choices can have a substantial effect on posterior inferences. Thus, considerations of robustness need to go hand in hand with nonparametric modeling. In the current paper, we tackle this challenge by exploiting the fact that variational Bayesian methods, in addition to having computational advantages in fitting complex nonparametric models, also yield sensitivities with respect to parametric and nonparametric aspects of Bayesian models. In particular, we demonstrate how to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the choice of concentration parameter and stick-breaking distribution for inferences under Dirichlet process mixtures and related mixture models.

A recent work brought out a peculiar property of the popular completely random measures (CRMs) as prior models in Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) inference for the unseen-features problem: for fixed prior's parameters, they all lead to a Poisson posterior distribution for the number of unseen features, which depends on the sampling information only through the sample size. CRMs are thus not a flexible prior model for the unseen-features problem and, while the Poisson posterior distribution may be appealing for analytical tractability and ease of interpretability, its independence from the sampling information makes the BNP approach a questionable oversimplification, with posterior inferences being completely determined by the estimation of unknown prior's parameters. In this paper, we introduce the stable-Beta scaled process (SB-SP) prior, and we show that it allows to enrich the posterior distribution of the number of unseen features arising under CRM priors, while maintaining its analytical tractability and interpretability. That is, the SB-SP prior leads to a negative Binomial posterior distribution, which depends on the sampling information through the sample size and the number of distinct features, with corresponding estimates being simple, linear in the sampling information and computationally efficient. We apply our BNP approach to synthetic data and to real cancer genomic data, showing that: i) it outperforms the most popular parametric and nonparametric competitors in terms of estimation accuracy; ii) it provides improved coverage for the estimation with respect to a BNP approach under CRM priors.\\n        \",\n",

Unfortunately, methods that simultaneously express sparsity, nonlinearity, and interactions are computationally intractable -- with runtime at least quadratic in the number of covariates, and often worse. In the present work, we solve this computational bottleneck. We show that suitable interaction models have a kernel representation, namely there exists a \"kernel trick\" to perform variable selection and estimation in $O$(# covariates) time. Our resulting fit corresponds to a sparse orthogonal decomposition of the regression function in a Hilbert space (i.e., a functional ANOVA decomposition), where interaction effects represent all variation that cannot be explained by lower-order effects.

       " '\\n        Computational couplings of Markov chains provide a practical route to unbiased Monte Carlo estimation that can utilize parallel computation. However, these approaches depend crucially on chains meeting after a small number of transitions. For models that assign data into groups, e.g. mixture models, the obvious approaches to couple Gibbs samplers fail to meet quickly. This failure owes to the so-called \"label-switching\" problem; semantically equivalent relabelings of the groups contribute well-separated posterior modes that impede fast mixing and cause large meeting times. We here demonstrate how to avoid label switching by considering chains as exploring the space of partitions rather than labelings. Using a metric on this space, we employ an optimal transport coupling of the Gibbs conditionals. This coupling outperforms alternative couplings that rely on labelings and, on a real dataset, provides estimates more precise than usual ergodic averages in the limited time regime.

Consequently, applied statisticians frequently face a difficult decision: retain a parameter estimate from a familiar method or replace it with an estimate from a newer or more complex one. While it is traditional to compare estimates using risk, such comparisons are rarely conclusive in realistic settings.\\n  In response, we propose the \"c-value\" as a measure of confidence that a new estimate achieves smaller loss than an old estimate on a given dataset. We show that it is unlikely that a large c-value coincides with a larger loss for the new estimate. Therefore, just as a small p-value supports rejecting a null hypothesis, a large c-value supports using a new estimate in place of the old. For a wide class of problems and estimates, we show how to compute a c-value by first constructing a data-dependent high-probability lower bound on the difference in loss. The c-value is frequentist in nature, but we show that it can provide validation of shrinkage estimates derived from Bayesian models in real data applications involving hierarchical models and Gaussian processes.\\n        ',\n",

Our metric, the \"Approximate Maximum Influence Perturbation,\" is automatically computable for common methods including (but not limited to) OLS, IV, MLE, GMM, and variational Bayes. We provide finite-sample error bounds on approximation performance. At minimal extra cost, we provide an exact finite-sample lower bound on sensitivity. We find that sensitivity is driven by a signal-to-noise ratio in the inference problem, is not reflected in standard errors, does not disappear asymptotically, and is not due to misspecification. While some empirical applications are robust, results of several economics papers can be overturned by removing less than 1% of the sample.\\n        ',\n",

However, managing the infinite dimensionality of CRMs typically requires practitioners to derive ad-hoc algorithms, preventing the use of general-purpose inference methods and often leading to long compute times. We propose a general but explicit recipe to construct a simple finite-dimensional approximation that can replace the infinite-dimensional CRMs. Our independent finite approximation (IFA) is a generalization of important cases that are used in practice. The independence of atom weights in our approximation (i) makes the construction well-suited for parallel and distributed computation and (ii) facilitates more convenient inference schemes. We quantify the approximation error between IFAs and the target nonparametric prior. We compare IFAs with an alternative approximation scheme -- truncated finite approximations (TFAs), where the atom weights are constructed sequentially. We prove that, for worst-case choices of observation likelihoods, TFAs are a more efficient approximation than IFAs. However, in real-data experiments with image denoising and topic modeling, we find that IFAs perform very similarly to TFAs in terms of task-specific accuracy metrics.\\n        ',\n",

In this setting, cross-validation (CV) serves as an important tool for model assessment. Recent advances in approximate cross validation (ACV) provide accurate approximations to CV with only a single model fit, avoiding traditional CV's requirement for repeated runs of expensive algorithms. Unfortunately, these ACV methods can lose both speed and accuracy in high dimensions -- unless sparsity structure is present in the data. Fortunately, there is an alternative type of simplifying structure that is present in most data: approximate low rank (ALR). Guided by this observation, we develop a new algorithm for ACV that is fast and accurate in the presence of ALR data. Our first key insight is that the Hessian matrix -- whose inverse forms the computational bottleneck of existing ACV methods -- is ALR. We show that, despite our use of the \\\\emph{inverse} Hessian, a low-rank approximation using the largest (rather than the smallest) matrix eigenvalues enables fast, reliable ACV. Our second key insight is that, in the presence of ALR data, error in existing ACV methods roughly grows with the (approximate, low) rank rather than with the (full, high) dimension. These insights allow us to prove theoretical guarantees on the quality of our proposed algorithm -- along with fast-to-compute upper bounds on its error. We demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our method, as well as the usefulness of our bounds, on a range of real and simulated data sets.\\n        \",\n",

A common suggestion is to use a finite mixture model (FMM) with a prior on the number of components. Past work has shown the resulting FMM component-count posterior is consistent; that is, the posterior concentrates on the true, generating number of components. But consistency requires the assumption that the component likelihoods are perfectly specified, which is unrealistic in practice. In this paper, we add rigor to data-analysis folk wisdom by proving that under even the slightest model misspecification, the FMM component-count posterior diverges: the posterior probability of any particular finite number of components converges to 0 in the limit of infinite data. Contrary to intuition, posterior-density consistency is not sufficient to establish this result. We develop novel sufficient conditions that are more realistic and easily checkable than those common in the asymptotics literature.

A gold standard evaluation technique is structured cross-validation (CV), which leaves out some data subset (such as data within a time interval or data in a geographic region) in each fold. But CV here can be prohibitively slow due to the need to re-run already-expensive learning algorithms many times. Previous work has shown approximate cross-validation (ACV) methods provide a fast and provably accurate alternative in the setting of empirical risk minimization. But this existing ACV work is restricted to simpler models by the assumptions that (i) data across CV folds are independent and (ii) an exact initial model fit is available. In structured data analyses, both these assumptions are often untrue. In the present work, we address (i) by extending ACV to CV schemes with dependence structure between the folds. To address (ii), we verify -- both theoretically and empirically -- that ACV quality deteriorates smoothly with noise in the initial fit.

Under a fixed budget, then, scientists face a natural trade-off between quantity and quality; they can spend resources to sequence a greater number of genomes (quantity) or spend resources to sequence genomes with increased accuracy (quality). Our goal is to find the optimal allocation of resources between quantity and quality. Optimizing resource allocation promises to reveal as many new variations in the genome as possible, and thus as many new scientific insights as possible. In this paper, we consider the common setting where scientists have already conducted a pilot study to reveal variants in a genome and are contemplating a follow-up study. We introduce a Bayesian nonparametric methodology to predict the number of new variants in the follow-up study based on the pilot study. When experimental conditions are kept constant between the pilot and follow-up, we demonstrate on real data from the gnomAD project that our prediction is more accurate than three recent proposals, and competitive with a more classic proposal. Unlike existing methods, though, our method allows practitioners to change experimental conditions between the pilot and the follow-up. We demonstrate how this distinction allows our method to be used for (i) more realistic predictions and (ii) optimal allocation of a fixed budget between quality and quantity.\\n        ',\n",

In this paper, we provide rigorous bounds on the error of posterior mean and uncertainty estimates that arise from full-distribution approximations, as in variational inference. Our bounds are widely applicable, as they require only that the approximating and exact posteriors have polynomial moments. Our bounds are also computationally efficient for variational inference because they require only standard values from variational objectives, straightforward analytic calculations, and simple Monte Carlo estimates. We show that our analysis naturally leads to a new and improved workflow for validated variational inference.

However, these methods require repeatedly re-fitting the model with different weighted versions of the original dataset, which can be prohibitively time-consuming. For sufficiently regular optimization problems the optimum depends smoothly on the data weights, and so the process of repeatedly re-fitting can be approximated with a Taylor series that can be often evaluated relatively quickly. The first-order approximation is known as the \"infinitesimal jackknife\" in the statistics literature and has been the subject of recent interest in machine learning for approximate CV. In this work, we consider high-order approximations, which we call the \"higher-order infinitesimal jackknife\" (HOIJ). Under mild regularity conditions, we provide a simple recursive procedure to compute approximations of all orders with finite-sample accuracy bounds. Additionally, we show that the HOIJ can be efficiently computed even in high dimensions using forward-mode automatic differentiation. We show that a linear approximation with bootstrap weights approximation is equivalent to those provided by asymptotic normal approximations. Consequently, the HOIJ opens up the possibility of enjoying higher-order accuracy properties of the bootstrap using local approximations. Consistency of the HOIJ for leave-one-out CV under different asymptotic regimes follows as corollaries from our finite-sample bounds under additional regularity assumptions.

We introduce the notion of local exchangeability -- where swapping data associated with nearby covariates causes a bounded change in the distribution. We prove that locally exchangeable processes correspond to independent observations from an underlying measure-valued stochastic process. Using this main probabilistic result, we show that the local empirical measure of a finite collection of observations provides an approximation of the underlying measure-valued process and Bayesian posterior predictive distributions.

Previous work has shown that approximations to LOOCV can be both fast and accurate -- when the unknown parameter is of small, fixed dimension. But these approximations incur a running time roughly cubic in dimension -- and we show that, besides computational issues, their accuracy dramatically deteriorates in high dimensions. Authors have suggested many potential and seemingly intuitive solutions, but these methods have not yet been systematically evaluated or compared. We find that all but one perform so poorly as to be unusable for approximating LOOCV. Crucially, though, we are able to show, both empirically and theoretically, that one approximation can perform well in high dimensions -- in cases where the high-dimensional parameter exhibits sparsity. Under interpretable assumptions, our theory demonstrates that the problem can be reduced to working within an empirically recovered (small) support. This procedure is straightforward to implement, and we prove that its running time and error depend on the (small) support size even when the full parameter dimension is large.\\n        \",\n",

Generalized linear models (GLMs) offer a particularly interpretable framework for such an analysis. In these high-dimensional problems, the number of covariates is often large relative to the number of observations, so we face non-trivial inferential uncertainty; a Bayesian approach allows coherent quantification of this uncertainty. Unfortunately, existing methods for Bayesian inference in GLMs require running times roughly cubic in parameter dimension, and so are limited to settings with at most tens of thousand parameters. We propose to reduce time and memory costs with a low-rank approximation of the data in an approach we call LR-GLM. When used with the Laplace approximation or Markov chain Monte Carlo, LR-GLM provides a full Bayesian posterior approximation and admits running times reduced by a full factor of the parameter dimension. We rigorously establish the quality of our approximation and show how the choice of rank allows a tunable computational-statistical trade-off. Experiments support our theory and demonstrate the efficacy of LR-GLM on real large-scale datasets.\\n        ',\n",

In theory, Bayesian methods for discovering pairwise interactions enjoy many benefits such as coherent uncertainty quantification, the ability to incorporate background knowledge, and desirable shrinkage properties. In practice, however, Bayesian methods are often computationally intractable for even moderate-dimensional problems. Our key insight is that many hierarchical models of practical interest admit a particular Gaussian process (GP) representation; the GP allows us to capture the posterior with a vector of O(p) kernel hyper-parameters rather than O(p^2) interactions and main effects. With the implicit representation, we can run Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) over model hyper-parameters in time and memory linear in p per iteration. We focus on sparsity-inducing models and show on datasets with a variety of covariate behaviors that our method: (1) reduces runtime by orders of magnitude over naive applications of MCMC, (2) provides lower Type I and Type II error relative to state-of-the-art LASSO-based approaches, and (3) offers improved computational scaling in high dimensions relative to existing Bayesian and LASSO-based approaches.\\n        ',\n",

This new type of data has led to the intriguing discovery that individual cell profiles can reflect the imprint of time or dynamic processes. However, synthesizing this information to reconstruct dynamic biological phenomena from data that are noisy, heterogenous, and sparse---and from processes that may unfold asynchronously---poses a complex computational and statistical challenge. Here, we develop a full generative model for probabilistically reconstructing trees of cellular differentiation from single-cell RNA-seq data. Specifically, we extend the framework of the classical Dirichlet diffusion tree to simultaneously infer branch topology and latent cell states along continuous trajectories over the full tree. In tandem, we construct a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler that interleaves Metropolis-Hastings and message passing to leverage model structure for efficient inference. Finally, we demonstrate that these techniques can recover latent trajectories from simulated single-cell transcriptomes. While this work is motivated by cellular differentiation, we derive a tractable model that provides flexible densities for any data (coupled with an appropriate noise model) that arise from continuous evolution along a latent nonparametric tree.\\n        ',\n",

At the same time, prior choice can have a substantial effect on posterior inferences. Thus, considerations of robustness need to go hand in hand with nonparametric modeling. In the current paper, we tackle this challenge by exploiting the fact that variational Bayesian methods, in addition to having computational advantages in fitting complex nonparametric models, also yield sensitivities with respect to parametric and nonparametric aspects of Bayesian models. In particular, we demonstrate how to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the choice of concentration parameter and stick-breaking distribution for inferences under Dirichlet process mixtures and related mixture models.

But, in order to achieve desirable theoretical guarantees, the former may require a prohibitively large number of features J+, and the latter may be prohibitively expensive for high-dimensional problems. We propose to combine the simplicity and generality of RFMs with a data-dependent feature selection scheme to achieve desirable theoretical approximation properties of Nystrom with just O(log J+) features. Our key insight is to begin with a large set of random features, then reduce them to a small number of weighted features in a data-dependent, computationally efficient way, while preserving the statistical guarantees of using the original large set of features. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with theory and experiments--including on a data set with over 50 million observations.

However, alternative methods, which are more scalable or apply to problems where Markov Chain Monte Carlo cannot be used, lack the same finite-data approximation theory and tools for evaluating their accuracy. In this work, we develop a flexible new approach to bounding the error of mean and uncertainty estimates of scalable inference algorithms. Our strategy is to control the estimation errors in terms of Wasserstein distance, then bound the Wasserstein distance via a generalized notion of Fisher distance. Unlike computing the Wasserstein distance, which requires access to the normalized posterior distribution, the Fisher distance is tractable to compute because it requires access only to the gradient of the log posterior density. We demonstrate the usefulness of our Fisher distance approach by deriving bounds on the Wasserstein error of the Laplace approximation and Hilbert coresets.

Our main contribution is a novel objective for approximate inference in the nonparametric setting: the preconditioned Fisher (pF) divergence. We show that unlike the Kullback--Leibler divergence (used in variational inference), the pF divergence bounds the 2-Wasserstein distance, which in turn provides tight bounds the pointwise difference of the mean and variance functions. We demonstrate that, for sparse GP likelihood approximations, we can minimize the pF divergence efficiently.

As a corollary, we state mild regularity conditions under which our approximation consistently estimates true leave-$k$-out cross-validation for any fixed $k$.

We demonstrate that these algorithms scale the coreset log-likelihood suboptimally, resulting in underestimated posterior uncertainty. To address this shortcoming, we develop greedy iterative geodesic ascent (GIGA), a novel algorithm for Bayesian coreset construction that scales the coreset log-likelihood optimally. GIGA provides geometric decay in posterior approximation error as a function of coreset size, and maintains the fast running time of its predecessors.

Because of its complexity, the Bayesian posterior often cannot be computed exactly, and approximations must be employed. Mean-field variational Bayes forms a posterior approximation by solving an optimization problem and is widely used due to its speed. An exact BNP posterior might vary dramatically when presented with different data. As such, stability and robustness of the clustering should be assessed.\\n  A popular mean to assess stability is to apply the bootstrap by resampling the data, and rerun the clustering for each simulated data set. The time cost is thus often very expensive, especially for the sort of exploratory analysis where clustering is typically used. We propose to use a fast and automatic approximation to the full bootstrap called the \"linear bootstrap\", which can be seen by local data perturbation. In this work, we demonstrate how to apply this idea to a data analysis pipeline, consisting of an MFVB approximation to a BNP clustering posterior of time course gene expression data.

Building on the Bayesian coresets framework, this work instead takes advantage of data redundancy to shrink the dataset itself as a preprocessing step, providing fully-automated, scalable Bayesian inference with theoretical guarantees. We begin with an intuitive reformulation of Bayesian coreset construction as sparse vector sum approximation, and demonstrate that its automation and performance-based shortcomings arise from the use of the supremum norm. To address these shortcomings we develop Hilbert coresets, i.e., Bayesian coresets constructed under a norm induced by an inner-product on the log-likelihood function space. We propose two Hilbert coreset construction algorithms---one based on importance sampling, and one based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm---along with theoretical guarantees on approximation quality as a function of coreset size. Since the exact computation of the proposed inner-products is model-specific, we automate the construction with a random finite-dimensional projection of the log-likelihood functions.

Furthermore, prior robustness measures have remained undeveloped for MFVB. By deriving a simple formula for the effect of infinitesimal model perturbations on MFVB posterior means, we provide both improved covariance estimates and local robustness measures for MFVB, thus greatly expanding the practical usefulness of MFVB posterior approximations. The estimates for MFVB posterior covariances rely on a result from the classical Bayesian robustness literature relating derivatives of posterior expectations to posterior covariances and include the Laplace approximation as a special case. Our key condition is that the MFVB approximation provides good estimates of a select subset of posterior means---an assumption that has been shown to hold in many practical settings.

We present an alternative notion of exchangeability for random graphs, which we call edge exchangeability, in which the distribution of a graph sequence is invariant to the order of the edges. We demonstrate that edge-exchangeable models, unlike models that are traditionally vertex exchangeable, can exhibit sparsity. To do so, we outline a general framework for graph generative models; by contrast to the pioneering work of Caron and Fox (2015), models within our framework are stationary across steps of the graph sequence.

A different, equally subjectively plausible choice of prior may result in a substantially different posterior, and so different conclusions drawn from the data. Were this to be the case, our conclusions would not be robust to the choice of prior. To determine whether our model is robust, we must quantify how sensitive our posterior is to perturbations of our prior.

We begin with local robustness, which measures the effect of infinitesimal changes to the prior on a posterior mean of interest. In particular, we show that the influence function of Gustafson (2012) has a simple, easy-to-calculate closed form expression for VB approximations. We then demonstrate how local robustness measures can be inadequate for non-local prior changes, such as replacing one prior entirely with another.

For practical reasons, the family of distributions in VI is usually constrained so that it does not include the exact posterior, even as a limit point. Thus, no matter how long VI is run, the resulting approximation will not approach the exact posterior. We propose to instead consider a more flexible approximating family consisting of all possible finite mixtures of a parametric base distribution (e.g., Gaussian). For efficient inference, we borrow ideas from gradient boosting to develop an algorithm we call boosting variational inference (BVI). BVI iteratively improves the current approximation by mixing it with a new component from the base distribution family and thereby yields progressively more accurate posterior approximations as more computing time is spent. Unlike a number of common VI variants including mean-field VI, BVI is able to capture multimodality, general posterior covariance, and nonstandard posterior shapes.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Trait allocations are a class of combinatorial structures in which data may belong to multiple groups and may have different levels of belonging in each group. Often the data are also exchangeable, i.e., their joint distribution is invariant to reordering. In clustering---a special case of trait allocation---exchangeability implies the existence of both a de Finetti representation and an exchangeable partition probability function (EPPF), distributional representations useful for computational and theoretical purposes. In this work, we develop the analogous de Finetti representation and exchangeable trait probability function (ETPF) for trait allocations, along with a characterization of all trait allocations with an ETPF. Unlike previous feature allocation characterizations, our proofs fully capture single-occurrence \"dust\" groups. We further introduce a novel constrained version of the ETPF that we use to establish an intuitive connection between the probability functions for clustering, feature allocations, and trait allocations. As an application of our general theory, we characterize the distribution of all edge-exchangeable graphs, a class of recently-developed models that captures realistic sparse graph sequences.\\n        ',\n",

Standard Bayesian inference algorithms are computationally expensive, however, making their direct application to large datasets difficult or infeasible. Recent work on scaling Bayesian inference has focused on modifying the underlying algorithms to, for example, use only a random data subsample at each iteration. We leverage the insight that data is often redundant to instead obtain a weighted subset of the data (called a coreset) that is much smaller than the original dataset. We can then use this small coreset in any number of existing posterior inference algorithms without modification. In this paper, we develop an efficient coreset construction algorithm for Bayesian logistic regression models. We provide theoretical guarantees on the size and approximation quality of the coreset -- both for fixed, known datasets, and in expectation for a wide class of data generative models. Crucially, the proposed approach also permits efficient construction of the coreset in both streaming and parallel settings, with minimal additional effort. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a number of synthetic and real-world datasets, and find that, in practice, the size of the coreset is independent of the original dataset size. Furthermore, constructing the coreset takes a negligible amount of time compared to that required to run MCMC on it.\\n        ',\n",

Since individual network datasets continue to grow in size, it is necessary to develop models that accurately represent the real-life scaling properties of networks. One behavior of interest is having a power law in the degree distribution. However, other types of power laws that have been observed empirically and considered for applications such as clustering and feature allocation models have not been studied as frequently in models for graph data. In this paper, we enumerate desirable asymptotic behavior that may be of interest for modeling graph data, including sparsity and several types of power laws. We outline a general framework for graph generative models using completely random measures; by contrast to the pioneering work of Caron and Fox (2015), we consider instantiating more of the existing atoms of the random measure as the dataset size increases rather than adding new atoms to the measure. We see that these two models can be complementary; they respectively yield interpretations as (1) time passing among existing members of a network and (2) new individuals joining a network. We detail a particular instance of this framework and show simulated results that suggest this model exhibits some desirable asymptotic power-law behavior.\\n        ',\n",

This behavior is considered unrealistic in observed graphs. We define a notion of edge exchangeability for random graphs in contrast to the established notion of infinite exchangeability for random graphs --- which has traditionally relied on exchangeability of nodes (rather than edges) in a graph. We show that, unlike node exchangeability, edge exchangeability encompasses models that are known to provide a projective sequence of random graphs that circumvent the Aldous-Hoover Theorem and exhibit sparsity, i.e., sub-quadratic growth of the number of edges with the number of nodes. We show how edge-exchangeability of graphs relates naturally to existing notions of exchangeability from clustering (a.k.a. partitions) and other familiar combinatorial structures.\\n        ',\n",

In this paper we detail two major classes of sequential CRM representations---series representations and superposition representations---within which we organize both novel and existing sequential representations that can be used for simulation and posterior inference. These two classes and their constituent representations subsume existing ones that have previously been developed in an ad hoc manner for specific processes. Since a complete infinite-dimensional CRM cannot be used explicitly for computation, sequential representations are often truncated for tractability. We provide truncation error analyses for each type of sequential representation, as well as their normalized versions, thereby generalizing and improving upon existing truncation error bounds in the literature. We analyze the computational complexity of the sequential representations, which in conjunction with our error bounds allows us to directly compare representations and discuss their relative efficiency. We include numerous applications of our theoretical results to commonly-used (normalized) CRMs, demonstrating that our results enable a straightforward representation and analysis of CRMs that has not previously been available in a Bayesian nonparametric context.\\n        ',\n",

In this paper we investigated reduced indium tin oxide (ITO) as a potential transparent superconductor for electronics. We fabricated and characterized superconducting wires of reduced indium tin oxide.

Semiconductor material properties such as charge carrier mobility or diffusion length are measured in bulk crystals and determined using models that describe transport behavior in homogeneous media, where structural boundary effects are minimal. However, most emerging semiconductors exhibit microscale heterogeneity. Therefore, experimental techniques with high spatial resolution paired with models that capture anisotropy and domain boundary behavior are needed. We develop a diffusion tensor-based framework to analyze experimental photoluminescence (PL) diffusion maps accounting for material microstructure. Specifically, we quantify both carrier transport and recombination in single crystal and polycrystalline lead halide perovskites by globally fitting diffusion maps, with spatial, temporal, and PL intensity data. We reveal a 29% difference in principal diffusion coefficients and alignment between electronically coupled grains for CH3NH3PbI3 polycrystalline films. This framework allows for understanding and optimizing anisotropic energy transport in heterogeneous materials.\\n        ',\n",

Similarly, surface modification of emerging halide perovskites with quasi-2D heterostructures is now ubiquitous to achieve PV power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) > 22% and has enabled single-junction PV devices to reach 25.7%, yet a fundamental understanding to how these treatments function is still generally lacking. This has established a bottleneck for maximizing beneficial improvements as no concrete selection and design rules currently exist. Here we uncover a new type of tunable passivation strategy and mechanism found in perovskite PV devices that were the first to reach the > 25% PCE milestone, which is enabled by surface treating a bulk perovskite layer with hexylammonium bromide (HABr). We uncover the simultaneous formation of an iodide-rich 2D layer along with a Br halide gradient achieved through partial halide exchange that extends from defective surfaces and grain boundaries into the bulk layer. We demonstrate and directly visualize the tunability of both the 2D layer thickness, halide gradient, and band structure using a unique combination of depth-sensitive nanoscale characterization techniques. We show that the optimization of this interface can extend the charge carrier lifetime to values > 30 Œºs, which is the longest value reported for a direct bandgap semiconductor (GaAs, InP, CdTe) over the past 50 years. Importantly, this work reveals an entirely new strategy and knob for optimizing and tuning recombination and charge transport at semiconductor interfaces and will likely establish new frontiers in achieving the next set of perovskite device performance records.\\n        ',\n",

In the strong coupling regime, polariton formation and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) have been demonstrated at room-temperature in several perovskite formulations. Thermodynamically, low-threshold BEC requires efficient scattering to $k_{||}$ = 0, and many applications demand precise control of polariton interactions. Thus far, the primary mechanisms by which polaritons relax in perovskites remains unclear. In this work, we perform temperature-dependent measurements of polaritons in low-dimensional hybrid perovskites with high light-matter coupling strengths ($\\\\hbar Œ©_{Rabi}$ = 260$\\\\pm$5 meV). By embedding the perovskite active layer in a wedged cavity, we are able to tune the Hopfield coefficients and decouple the primary polariton relaxation mechanisms in this material for the first time. We observe the thermal activation of a bottleneck regime, and reveal that this effect can be overcome by harnessing intrinsic scattering mechanisms arising from the interplay between the different excitonic species, such as biexciton-assisted polariton relaxation pathways, and isoenergetic intracavity pumping. We demonstrate the dependence of the bottleneck suppression on cavity detuning, and are able to achieve efficient relaxation to $k_{||}$ = 0 even at cryogenic temperatures. This new understanding contributes to the design of ultra-low-threshold BEC and condensate control by engineering polariton dispersions resonant with efficient relaxation pathways, leveraging intrinsic material scattering mechanisms for next-generation polariton optoelectronics.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        State-of-the-art metal halide perovskite-based photovoltaics often employ organic ammonium salts, AX, as a surface passivator, where A is a large organic cation and X is a halide. These surface treatments passivate the perovskite by forming layered perovskites (e.g., A2PbX4) or by AX itself serving as a surface passivation agent on the perovskite photoactive film. It remains unclear whether layered perovskites or AX is the ideal passivator due to an incomplete understanding of the interfacial impact and resulting photoexcited carrier dynamics of AX treatment. In the present study, we use TRPL measurements to selectively probe the different interfaces of glass/perovskite/AX to demonstrate the vastly distinct interfacial photoexcited state dynamics with the presence of A2PbX4 or AX. Coupling the TRPL results with X-ray diffraction and nanoscale microscopy measurements, we find that the presence of AX not only passivates the traps at the surface and the grain boundaries, but also induces an Œ±/Œ¥-FAPbI3 phase mixing that alters the carrier dynamics near the glass/perovskite interface and enhances the photoluminescence quantum yield. In contrast, the passivation with A2PbI4 is mostly localized to the surface and grain boundaries near the top surface where the availability of PbI2 directly determines the formation of A2PbI4. Such distinct mechanisms significantly impact the corresponding solar cell performance, and we find AX passivation that has not been converted to a layered perovskite allows for a much larger processing window (e.g., larger allowed variance of AX concentration which is critical for improving the eventual manufacturing yield) and more reproducible condition to realize device performance improvements, while A2PbI4 as a passivator yields a much narrower processing window. We expect these results to enable a more rational route for developing AX for perovskite.\\n        ',\n",

However, a fundamental issue that limits the performance of these devices is the quenching of photoluminescence due to excess charges from conductive charge transport layers. Although device designs have leveraged various workarounds, doing so often comes at the cost of limiting efficient charge injection. Here we demonstrate that high-field terahertz (THz) pulses can dramatically brighten quenched QDs on metallic surfaces, an effect which persists for minutes after THz irradiation. This phenomenon is attributed to the ability of the THz field to remove excess charges, thereby reducing trion and non-radiative Auger recombination. Our findings show that THz technologies can be used to suppress and control such undesired non-radiative decay, potentially in a variety of luminescent materials for future device applications.\\n        ',\n",

Utilizing field-induced luminescence quenching, we show that a large electric field can strongly modify carrier dynamics in this nanostructured device, resulting in stable and reversible photoluminescence quenching. The device exhibits photoluminescence reduction of up to 99.5%, corresponding to a contrast ratio of 200:1, under the applied electric field of 3 MV/cm, with a 300 nanosecond response time. Using excitation wavelength dependent and transient PL spectroscopy, we further show that the high degree of quenching is achieved by a synergistic interplay of quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) and field-induced exciton dissociation.\\n        ',\n",

This requires their precise integration into functional heterojunctions, most commonly in the form of metal-molecule-metal architectures. Structural damage and nonuniformities caused by current fabrication techniques, however, limit their effective incorporation. Here, we present a hybrid fabrication approach enabling uniform molecular gaps. Template-stripped lithographically-patterned gold electrodes with sub-nanometer roughness are used as the bottom contacts upon which the molecular layer is formed through self-assembly. The top contacts are assembled using dielectrophoretic trapping of colloidal gold nanorods, resulting in uniform sub-5 nm junctions. In these electrically-active designs, we further explore the possibility of mechanical tunability. The presence of molecules may help control sub-nanometer mechanical modulation which is conventionally difficult to achieve due to instabilities caused by surface adhesive forces.

D is often determined by fitting a time-resolved expanding carrier profile after optical excitation using a Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) Model. Although this approach has gained widespread adoption, its utilization can significantly overestimate D due to the non-linear recombination processes that artificially broaden the carrier distribution profile. Here, we simulate diffusive processes in both excitonic and free carrier semiconductors and present revised MSD Models that take into account second-order (i.e. bimolecular) and third-order (i.e. Auger) processes to accurately recover D for various types of materials. For perovskite thin films, utilization of these models can reduce fitting error by orders of magnitude, especially for commonly deployed excitation conditions where carrier densities are > 5x10$^1$$^6$ cm$^-$$^3$. In addition, we show that commonly-deployed MSD Models are not well-suited for the study of films with microstructure, especially when boundary behavior is unknown and feature sizes are comparable to the diffusion length. Finally, we find that photon recycling only impacts energy carrier profiles on ultrashort time scales or for materials with fast radiative decay times.

In particular, the transition from 2H to 1T'-MoTe$_2$, which was thought to be induced by high-energy photon irradiation among many other means, has been intensely studied for its technological relevance in nanoscale transistors. Despite the remarkable electrical performance arising from this 2H-to-1T' transition, it remains controversial whether a crystalline 1T' phase is produced because optical signatures of this putative transition are found to be associated with the formation of elemental Te clusters instead. Here, we demonstrate the creation of an intrinsic 1T' lattice after irradiating a mono- or few-layer 2H-MoTe$_2$ with a single field-enhanced terahertz pulse, whose low photon energy limits possible structural damage by optical pulses. To visualize the temporal evolution of this irreversible transition, we further develop a single-shot terahertz pump-second harmonic probe technique, and we find that the transition out of the 2H phase occurs within 10 ns after photoexcitation. Our results not only resolve the long-standing debate over the light-induced polymorphic transition in MoTe$_2$, they also highlight the unique capability of strong-field terahertz pulses in manipulating the structure of quantum materials.\\n        \",\n",

In this contribution, we take advantage of long carrier lifetimes and carrier diffusion lengths in perovskite thin films, their high absorption cross sections throughout the visible spectrum, as well as the strong spin-orbit coupling owing to the abundance of heavy atoms to sensitize the upconverter rubrene. Employing bulk perovskite thin films as the absorber layer and spin-mixer in inorganic/organic heterojunction upconversion devices allows us to forego the additional tunneling barrier owing from the passivating ligands required for colloidal sensitizers.

Even with finite non-radiative recombination, benefits from photon recycling can be achieved when non-radiative lifetimes and external LED electroluminescence efficiencies measured at open-circuit, $Q_{e}^{LED}(\\\\textrm{V}_{OC})$, exceed 2 $Œº$s and 10%, respectively.

Despite a remarkable defect tolerance compared to conventional semiconductors, perovskite thin films still show substantial microscale heterogeneity in key properties such as luminescence efficiency and device performance. This behavior has been attributed to spatial fluctuations in the population of sub-bandgap electronic states that act as trap-mediated non-radiative recombination sites. However, the origin of the variations, trap states and extent of the defect tolerance remains a topic of debate, and a precise understanding is critical to the rational design of defect management strategies. By combining scanning X-ray diffraction beamlines at two different synchrotrons with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, we reveal levels of heterogeneity on the ten-micrometer scale (super-grains) and even ten-nanometer scale (sub-grain domains). We find that local strain is associated with enhanced defect concentrations, and correlations between the local structure and time-resolved photoluminescence reveal that these strain-related defects are the cause of non-radiative recombination. We reveal a direct connection between defect concentrations and non-radiative losses, as well as complex heterogeneity across multiple length scales, shedding new light on the presence and influence of structural defects in halide perovskites.\\n        ',\n",

Earlier studies of quasi-DC electric field modulation of QD properties have been limited by the electrostatic breakdown processes under the high externally applied electric fields, which have restricted the range of modulation of QD properties. In contrast, in the present work we drive CdSe:CdS core:shell QD films with high-field THz-frequency electromagnetic pulses whose duration is only a few picoseconds. Surprisingly, in response to the THz excitation we observe QD luminescence even in the absence of an external charge source. Our experiments show that QD luminescence is associated with a remarkably high and rapid modulation of the QD band-gap, which is changing by more than 0.5 eV (corresponding to 25% of the unperturbed bandgap energy) within the picosecond timeframe of THz field profile. We show that these colossal energy shifts can be consistently explained by the quantum confined Stark effect. Our work demonstrates a route to extreme modulation of material properties without configurational changes in material sets or geometries. Additionally, we expect that this platform can be adapted to a novel compact THz detection scheme where conversion of THz fields (with meV-scale photon energies) to the visible/near-IR band (with eV-scale photon energies) can be achieved at room temperature with high bandwidth and sensitivity.\\n        ',\n",

These Dirac cones may open up in energy by simultaneously interfacing the metal with a magneto-optical layer and subjecting the whole system to a perpendicular magnetic field. The resulting energy gap becomes populated with topologically protected one-way modes which travel at the interface of this plexcitonic system.

Automating this scheduling problem is challenging because maintenance job duration varies based on both job type and hardware. While it is tempting to use prior machine learning techniques for predicting job duration, we find that the structure of the maintenance job scheduling problem creates a unique challenge. In particular, we show that prior machine learning methods that produce the lowest error predictions do not produce the best scheduling outcomes due to asymmetric costs. Specifically, underpredicting maintenance job duration has results in more servers being taken offline and longer server downtime than overpredicting maintenance job duration. The system cost of underprediction is much larger than that of overprediction.\\n  We present Acela, a machine learning system for predicting maintenance job duration, which uses quantile regression to bias duration predictions toward overprediction. We integrate Acela into a maintenance job scheduler and evaluate it on datasets from large-scale, production datacenters.

A long-standing hypothesis based on bias-variance trade-off attributes this generalization improvement to model size reduction. However, recent studies on over-parameterization characterize a new model size regime, in which larger models achieve better generalization. Pruning models in this over-parameterized regime leads to a contradiction -- while theory predicts that reducing model size harms generalization, pruning to a range of sparsities nonetheless improves it. Motivated by this contradiction, we re-examine pruning's effect on generalization empirically.\\n  We show that size reduction cannot fully account for the generalization-improving effect of standard pruning algorithms. Instead, we find that pruning leads to better training at specific sparsities, improving the training loss over the dense model. We find that pruning also leads to additional regularization at other sparsities, reducing the accuracy degradation due to noisy examples over the dense model. Pruning extends model training time and reduces model size. These two factors improve training and add regularization respectively.

Prior work uses machine learning to automatically tune hardware resources such that the system execution meets safety constraints optimally. Such solutions monitor past system executions to learn the system's behavior under different hardware resource allocations before dynamically tuning resources to optimize the application execution. However, system behavior can change significantly between different applications and even different inputs of the same applications. Hence, the models learned using data collected a priori are often suboptimal and violate safety constraints when used with new applications and inputs. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of an execution space, which is the cross product of hardware resources, input features, and applications. To dynamically and safely allocate hardware resources from the execution space, we present SCOPE, a resource manager that leverages a novel safe exploration framework. We evaluate SCOPE's ability to deliver improved latency while minimizing power constraint violations by dynamically configuring hardware while running a variety of Apache Spark applications. Compared to prior approaches that minimize power constraint violations, SCOPE consumes comparable power while improving latency by up to 9.5X.

Instead of randomly sampling from the configuration space, SEML reduces the search cost by dramatically reducing the number of configurations that must be sampled to optimize system goals (e.g., low latency or energy). Nevertheless, SEML only reduces one component of cost -- the total number of samples collected -- but does not decrease the cost of collecting each sample. Critically, not all samples are equal; some take much longer to collect because they correspond to slow system configurations. This paper present Cello, a computer systems optimization framework that reduces sample collection costs -- especially those that come from the slowest configurations. The key insight is to predict ahead of time whether samples will have poor system behavior (e.g., long latency or high energy) and terminate these samples early before their measured system behavior surpasses the termination threshold, which we call it predictive early termination. To predict the future system behavior accurately before it manifests as high runtime or energy, Cello uses censored regression to produces accurate predictions for running samples. We evaluate Cello by optimizing latency and energy for Apache Spark workloads. We give Cello a fixed amount of time to search a combined space of hardware and software configuration parameters. Our evaluation shows that compared to the state-of-the-art SEML approach in computer systems optimization, Cello improves latency by 1.19X for minimizing latency under a power constraint, and improves energy by 1.18X for minimizing energy under a latency constraint.\\n        ',\n",

Despite these advancements, there are fundamental limitations to how well this problem can be solved. Previous studies have alluded to this fact but have not examined it in depth. In this paper, we address the tractability of reinforcement learning for general LTL objectives from a theoretical perspective. We formalize the problem under the probably approximately correct learning in Markov decision processes (PAC-MDP) framework, a standard framework for measuring sample complexity in reinforcement learning. In this formalization, we prove that the optimal policy for any LTL formula is PAC-MDP-learnable if and only if the formula is in the most limited class in the LTL hierarchy, consisting of formulas that are decidable within a finite horizon. Practically, our result implies that it is impossible for a reinforcement-learning algorithm to obtain a PAC-MDP guarantee on the performance of its learned policy after finitely many interactions with an unconstrained environment for LTL objectives that are not decidable within a finite horizon.\\n        ',\n",

Prior work introduced a probabilistic programming language, ProbZelus, to extend probabilistic programming functionality to unbounded streams of data. This work demonstrated that the delayed sampling inference algorithm could be extended to work in a streaming context. ProbZelus showed that while delayed sampling could be effectively deployed on some programs, depending on the probabilistic model under consideration, delayed sampling is not guaranteed to use a bounded amount of memory over the course of the execution of the program.\\n  In this paper, we present conditions on a probabilistic program's execution under which delayed sampling will execute in bounded memory. The two conditions are dataflow properties of the core operations of delayed sampling: the $m$-consumed property and the unseparated paths property. A program executes in bounded memory under delayed sampling if, and only if, it satisfies the $m$-consumed and unseparated paths properties. We propose a static analysis that abstracts over these properties to soundly ensure that any program that passes the analysis satisfies these properties, and thus executes in bounded memory under delayed sampling.\\n        \",\n",

From a shared ResNet-20 initialization, we train several network copies (\\\\emph{siblings}) to completion using different SGD data orders on CIFAR-10. While the siblings' pruning masks are naively not much more similar than chance, starting sibling training after a few epochs of shared pretraining significantly increases pruning overlap. We then choose a subnetwork by either (1) taking all weights that survive pruning in any sibling (mask union), or (2) taking only the weights that survive pruning across all siblings (mask intersection). The resulting subnetwork is retrained. Strikingly, we find that union and intersection masks perform very similarly. Both methods match the accuracy-sparsity tradeoffs of the one-shot magnitude pruning baseline, even when we combine masks from up to $k = 10$ siblings.\\n        \",\n",

In safety-critical domains, to formally verify safety properties developers may write an environment model. The model captures the relationship between observations and hidden states and is used to prove the software correct.\\n  In this paper, we present a new methodology for writing and verifying programs in partially observable environments.

A belief program dynamically updates and queries a belief state that captures the possible states the environment could be in. To enable verification, we present Epistemic Hoare Logic that reasons about the possible belief states of a belief program the same way that classical Hoare logic reasons about the possible states of a program. We develop these concepts by defining a semantics and a program logic for a simple core language called BLIMP.

We are hereby curious and ask: after pre-training, does a pre-trained model indeed have to stay large for its downstream transferability?\\n  In this paper, we examine supervised and self-supervised pre-trained models through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH). LTH identifies highly sparse matching subnetworks that can be trained in isolation from (nearly) scratch yet still reach the full models' performance. We extend the scope of LTH and question whether matching subnetworks still exist in pre-trained computer vision models, that enjoy the same downstream transfer performance. Our extensive experiments convey an overall positive message: from all pre-trained weights obtained by ImageNet classification, simCLR, and MoCo, we are consistently able to locate such matching subnetworks at 59.04% to 96.48% sparsity that transfer universally to multiple downstream tasks, whose performance see no degradation compared to using full pre-trained weights. Further analyses reveal that subnetworks found from different pre-training tend to yield diverse mask structures and perturbation sensitivities. We conclude that the core LTH observations remain generally relevant in the pre-training paradigm of computer vision, but more delicate discussions are needed in some cases.

This complexity arises from the expertise required to design benchmarks and measurement frameworks that can precisely measure the values of parameters at such fine granularity. In some cases, these parameters do not necessarily have a physical realization and are therefore fundamentally approximate, or even unmeasurable.\\n  In this paper we present DiffTune, a system for learning the parameters of x86 basic block CPU simulators from coarse-grained end-to-end measurements. Given a simulator, DiffTune learns its parameters by first replacing the original simulator with a differentiable surrogate, another function that approximates the original function; by making the surrogate differentiable, DiffTune is then able to apply gradient-based optimization techniques even when the original function is non-differentiable, such as is the case with CPU simulators. With this differentiable surrogate, DiffTune then applies gradient-based optimization to produce values of the simulator's parameters that minimize the simulator's error on a dataset of ground truth end-to-end performance measurements. Finally, the learned parameters are plugged back into the original simulator.\\n  DiffTune is able to automatically learn the entire set of microarchitecture-specific parameters within the Intel x86 simulation model of llvm-mca, a basic block CPU simulator based on LLVM's instruction scheduling model.

Although these methods surpass the trivial baseline of random pruning, they remain below the accuracy of magnitude pruning after training, and we endeavor to understand why. We show that, unlike pruning after training, randomly shuffling the weights these methods prune within each layer or sampling new initial values preserves or improves accuracy. As such, the per-weight pruning decisions made by these methods can be replaced by a per-layer choice of the fraction of weights to prune.

In this work, we combine these observations to assess whether such trainable, transferrable subnetworks exist in pre-trained BERT models. For a range of downstream tasks, we indeed find matching subnetworks at 40% to 90% sparsity. We find these subnetworks at (pre-trained) initialization, a deviation from prior NLP research where they emerge only after some amount of training. Subnetworks found on the masked language modeling task (the same task used to pre-train the model) transfer universally; those found on other tasks transfer in a limited fashion if at all.

In this paper, we compare fine-tuning to alternative retraining techniques. Weight rewinding (as proposed by Frankle et al., (2019)), rewinds unpruned weights to their values from earlier in training and retrains them from there using the original training schedule.

Several recent results have explored the possibility of pruning at initialization time to provide similar benefits during training. In particular, the \"lottery ticket hypothesis\" conjectures that typical neural networks contain small subnetworks that can train to similar accuracy in a commensurate number of steps. The evidence for this claim is that a procedure based on iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) reliably finds such subnetworks retroactively on small vision tasks. However, IMP fails on deeper networks, and proposed methods to prune before training or train pruned networks encounter similar scaling limitations. In this paper, we argue that these efforts have struggled on deeper networks because they have focused on pruning precisely at initialization. We modify IMP to search for subnetworks that could have been obtained by pruning early in training (0.1% to 7% through) rather than at iteration 0. With this change, it finds small subnetworks of deeper networks (e.g., 80% sparsity on Resnet-50) that can complete the training process to match the accuracy of the original network on more challenging tasks (e.g., ImageNet). In situations where IMP fails at iteration 0, the accuracy benefits of delaying pruning accrue rapidly over the earliest iterations of training. To explain these behaviors, we study subnetwork \"stability,\" finding that - as accuracy improves in this fashion - IMP subnetworks train to parameters closer to those of the full network and do so with improved consistency in the face of gradient noise.

For bootstrapping a fully-packed ciphertext, while operating at 300 MHz, FAB outperforms existing state-of-the-art CPU and GPU implementations by 213x and 1.5x respectively. Our target FHE application is training a logistic regression model over encrypted data. For logistic regression model training scaled to 8 FPGAs on the cloud, FAB outperforms a CPU and GPU by 456x and 6.5x and provides competitive performance when compared to the state-of-the-art ASIC design at a fraction of the cost.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows arbitrarily complex computations on encrypted data without ever needing to decrypt it, thus enabling us to maintain data privacy on third-party systems. Unfortunately, sustaining deep computations with FHE requires a periodic noise reduction step known as bootstrapping. The cost of the bootstrapping operation is one of the primary barriers to the wide-spread adoption of FHE. In this paper, we present an in-depth architectural analysis of the bootstrapping step in FHE. First, we observe that secure implementations of bootstrapping exhibit a low arithmetic intensity (<1 Op/byte), require large caches (>100 MB), and are heavily bound by the main memory bandwidth. Consequently, we demonstrate that existing workloads observe marginal performance gains from the design of bespoke high-throughput arithmetic units tailored to FHE. Second, we propose several cache-friendly algorithmic optimizations that improve the throughput in FHE bootstrapping by enabling up to 3.2x higher arithmetic intensity and 4.6x lower memory bandwidth. Our optimizations apply to a wide range of structurally similar computations such as private evaluation and training of machine learning models. Finally, we incorporate these optimizations into an architectural tool which, given a cache size, memory subsystem, the number of functional units and a desired security level, selects optimal cryptosystem parameters to maximize the bootstrapping throughput. Our optimized bootstrapping implementation represents a best-case scenario for compute acceleration of FHE. We show that despite these optimizations, bootstrapping continues to be bottlenecked by main memory bandwidth. We propose new research directions to address the underlying memory bottleneck. In summary, our answer to the titular question is: yes, but only after addressing the memory bottleneck!\\n        ',\n",

However, cryptography has been an exception, where many performance-critical routines have been written directly in assembly (sometimes through metaprogramming layers). Some past work has shown how to do formal verification of that assembly, and other work has shown how to generate C code automatically along with formal proof, but with consequent performance penalties vs. the best-known assembly. We present CryptOpt, the first compilation pipeline that specializes high-level cryptographic functional programs into assembly code significantly faster than what GCC or Clang produce, with mechanized proof (in Coq) whose final theorem statement mentions little beyond the input functional program and the operational semantics of x86-64 assembly. On the optimization side, we apply randomized search through the space of assembly programs, with repeated automatic benchmarking on target CPUs. On the formal-verification side, we connect to the Fiat Cryptography framework (which translates functional programs into C-like IR code) and extend it with a new formally verified program-equivalence checker, incorporating a modest subset of known features of SMT solvers and symbolic-execution engines. The overall prototype is quite practical, e.g. producing new fastest-known implementations for the relatively new Intel i9 12G, of finite-field arithmetic for both Curve25519 (part of the TLS standard) and the Bitcoin elliptic curve secp256k1.\\n        ',\n",

Now each rewrite rule can be proved separately, with no need to revisit past proofs for other parts of the compiler. We present the first realization of this idea, in the form of a framework for the Coq proof assistant. Our new Coq command takes normal proved theorems and combines them automatically into fast compilers with proofs.

Our tool eliminates the overhead of having to download, set up, compile, and then explore and understand large developments: enabling Coq developers to easily obtain modular test-case files for fast experimentation. In this paper, we describe insights about how test-case reduction is different in Coq than in traditional compilers. We expect that our insights will generalize to other proof assistants. We evaluate the Coq Bug Minimizer on over 150 CI failures. Our tool succeeds in reducing failures to smaller test cases in roughly 75% of the time. The minimizer produces a fully standalone test case 89% of the time, and it is on average about one-third the size of the original test.

Many verification, synthesis, programming, and debugging tools rely on formal semantics of instruction sets, but different tools can use semantics in rather different ways. As a result, a central challenge for that community is how semantics should be written and what techniques should be used to connect them to new use cases. The best-known work applying single semantics across quite-different tools relies on domain-specific languages like Sail, where the language and its translation tools are specialized to the realm of instruction sets. We decided to explore a different approach, with semantics written in a carefully chosen subset of Haskell. This style does not depend on any new language translators, relying instead on parameterization of semantics over type-class instances. As a result, a semantics can be a first-class object within a logic, and application of a semantics for a new kind of tool can be a first-class operation in the logic, allowing sharing of theorems across applications. Our case study is for the open RISC-V instruction-set family, and we have used a single core semantics to support testing, interactive proof, and model checking of both software and hardware. We especially highlight an application of a first-class semantics within Coq that can be instantiated in different ways within one proof: simulation between variants where multiplication is implemented in hardware or in the machine code of a particular software trap handler.\\n        ',\n",

In these systems, it is impossible to compute (total and deterministic) discrete decisions based on connected spaces such as $\\\\mathbb{R}$. We present programming-language semantics based on constructive topology with variants allowing nondeterminism and/or partiality. Either nondeterminism or partiality suffices to allow computable decision making on connected spaces such as $\\\\mathbb{R}$. We then introduce pattern matching on spaces, a language construct for creating programs on spaces, generalizing pattern matching in functional programming, where patterns need not represent decidable predicates and also may overlap or be inexhaustive, giving rise to nondeterminism or partiality, respectively. Nondeterminism and/or partiality also yield formal logics for constructing approximate decision procedures.

Most past parser-combinator approaches cannot handle these formats, and the few exceptions require redundancy -- one part of the natural grammar needs to be hand-translated into hints in multiple parts of a parser program. We show how to recover very natural and nonredundant format specifications, covering all popular network packet formats and generating both decoders and encoders automatically. The catch is that we use the Coq proof assistant to derive both kinds of artifacts using tactics, automatically, in a way that guarantees that they form inverses of each other.

One scalable method to construct an MNQC is using superconducting quantum systems with optical interconnects. However, a limiting factor of these machines will be internode gates, which may be two to three orders of magnitude noisier and slower than local operations. Surmounting the limitations of internode gates will require a range of techniques, including improvements in entanglement generation, the use of entanglement distillation, and optimized software and compilers, and it remains unclear how improvements to these components interact to affect overall system performance, what performance from each is required, or even how to quantify the performance of each. In this paper, we employ a `co-design' inspired approach to quantify overall MNQC performance in terms of hardware models of internode links, entanglement distillation, and local architecture. In the case of superconducting MNQCs with microwave-to-optical links, we uncover a tradeoff between entanglement generation and distillation that threatens to degrade performance. We show how to navigate this tradeoff, lay out how compilers should optimize between local and internode gates, and discuss when noisy quantum links have an advantage over purely classical links. Using these results, we introduce a roadmap for the realization of early MNQCs which illustrates potential improvements to the hardware and software of MNQCs and outlines criteria for evaluating the landscape, from progress in entanglement generation and quantum memory to dedicated algorithms such as distributed quantum phase estimation.

Finding such a classical code can be very difficult. Here, we consider an algorithm which maps the search for CWS codes to a problem of identifying maximum cliques in a graph. While solving this problem is in general very hard, we prove three structure theorems which reduce the search space, specifying certain admissible and optimal ((n,K,d)) additive codes. In particular, we find there does not exist any ((7,3,3)) CWS code though the linear programming bound does not rule it out.

It allows a sender (Alice) to sign a message in such a way that the signature can be validated by a number of different people, and all will agree either that the message came from Alice or that it has been tampered with. To accomplish this task, each recipient of the message must have a copy of Alice\\'s \"public key,\" which is a set of quantum states whose exact identity is known only to Alice. Quantum public keys are more difficult to deal with than classical public keys: for instance, only a limited number of copies can be in circulation, or the scheme becomes insecure. However, in exchange for this price, we achieve unconditionally secure digital signatures. Sending an m-bit message uses up O(m) quantum bits for each recipient of the public key. We briefly discuss how to securely distribute quantum public keys, and show the signature scheme is absolutely secure using one method of key distribution.

Poplar protects client privacy against arbitrary misbehavior by one of the servers and our approach requires no public-key cryptography (except for secure channels), nor general-purpose multiparty computation. Instead, we rely on incremental distributed point functions, a new cryptographic tool that allows a client to succinctly secret-share the labels on the nodes of an exponentially large binary tree, provided that the tree has a single non-zero path.

Decentralizing trust while respecting the resource limits of today's HSMs requires a synthesis of systems-design principles and cryptographic tools. We evaluate SafetyPin on a cluster of 100 low-cost HSMs and show that a SafetyPin-protected recovery takes 1.01 seconds.

We introduce a new threat model, under which there is a systemic solution to such randomness flaws. In our model, when a device generates a cryptographic key, it incorporates some random values from an entropy authority into its cryptographic secrets and then proves to the authority, using zero-knowledge-proof techniques, that it performed this operation correctly. By presenting an entropy-authority-signed public-key certificate to a third party (like a certificate authority or SSH client), the device can demonstrate that its public key incorporates randomness from the authority and is therefore drawn from a large pool of candidate values. Where possible, our protocol protects against eavesdroppers, entropy authority misbehavior, and devices attempting to discredit the entropy authority. To demonstrate the practicality of our protocol, we have implemented and evaluated its performance on a commodity wireless home router.

Traditionally, it is assumed that the entries of the matrix are \"missing completely at random\" (MCAR), i.e., each entry is revealed at random, independent of everything else, with uniform probability. This is likely unrealistic due to the presence of \"latent confounders\", i.e., unobserved factors that determine both the entries of the underlying matrix and the missingness pattern in the observed matrix. For example, in the context of movie recommender systems -- a canonical application for matrix completion -- a user who vehemently dislikes horror films is unlikely to ever watch horror films. In general, these confounders yield \"missing not at random\" (MNAR) data, which can severely impact any inference procedure that does not correct for this bias. We develop a formal causal model for matrix completion through the language of potential outcomes, and provide novel identification arguments for a variety of causal estimands of interest. We design a procedure, which we call \"synthetic nearest neighbors\" (SNN), to estimate these causal estimands. We prove finite-sample consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimator. Our analysis also leads to new theoretical results for the matrix completion literature. In particular, we establish entry-wise, i.e., max-norm, finite-sample consistency and asymptotic normality results for matrix completion with MNAR data.

However, existing routing solutions do not address where drivers should travel after dropping off a passenger and before receiving the next passenger ride request, i.e., during the between-ride period. We address this problem by developing an efficient algorithm to find the optimal policy for drivers between rides in order to maximize driver profits. We model the road network as a graph, and we show that the between-ride routing problem is equivalent to a stochastic shortest path problem, an infinite dynamic program with no discounting. We prove under reasonable assumptions that an optimal routing policy exists that avoids cycles; policies of this type can be efficiently found. We present an iterative approach to find an optimal routing policy. Our approach can account for various factors, including the frequency of passenger ride requests at different locations, traffic conditions, and surge pricing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by implementing it on road network data from Boston and New York City.\\n        ',\n",

While the monetization of data and pre-trained models is an essential focus of industry today, there does not exist a market mechanism to price training data and match buyers to sellers while still addressing the associated (computational and other) complexity. The challenge in creating such a market stems from the very nature of data as an asset: (i) it is freely replicable; (ii) its value is inherently combinatorial due to correlation with signal in other data; (iii) prediction tasks and the value of accuracy vary widely; (iv) usefulness of training data is difficult to verify a priori without first applying it to a prediction task. As our main contributions we: (i) propose a mathematical model for a two-sided data market and formally define the key associated challenges; (ii) construct algorithms for such a market to function and analyze how they meet the challenges defined.

A random Fourier features mapping is embedded into $B_1^{+}$ Net, which allows it to learn the $B_1^{+}$ field more efficiently.

MR-based electrical properties tomography (MR-EPT) uses MR measurements to reconstruct the EP maps. Using the homogeneous Helmholtz equation, EP can be directly computed through calculations of second order spatial derivatives of the measured magnetic transmit or receive fields $(B_{1}^{+}, B_{1}^{-})$. However, the numerical approximation of derivatives leads to noise amplifications in the measurements and thus erroneous reconstructions. Recently, a noise-robust supervised learning-based method (DL-EPT) was introduced for EP reconstruction. However, the pattern-matching nature of such network does not allow it to generalize for new samples since the network's training is done on a limited number of simulated data. In this work, we leverage recent developments on physics-informed deep learning to solve the Helmholtz equation for the EP reconstruction.

By comparing the ratio of area-under-curve between the raw data and their representations, SynBench offers a quantifiable score for robustness-accuracy performance benchmarking. Our framework applies to a wide range of pretrained models taking continuous data inputs and is independent of the downstream tasks and datasets. Evaluated with several pretrained vision transformer models, the experimental results show that our SynBench score well matches the actual linear probing performance of the pre-trained model when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. Moreover, our framework can be used to inform the design of robust linear probing on pretrained representations to mitigate the robustness-accuracy tradeoff in downstream tasks.\\n        ',\n",

We calculated the RF transmit field ($B_1^+$) inside heterogeneous head models for different RF shimming approaches, and used them as input for GMT to reconstruct EP for all voxels. Results: Coil tuning/decoupling remained relatively stable when the coil was loaded with different head models. Mean error in EP estimation changed from $7.5\\\\%$ to $9.5\\\\%$ and from $4.8\\\\%$ to $7.2\\\\%$ for relative permittivity and conductivity, respectively, when changing head model without re-tuning the coil.

We propose a novel probabilistic framework PROVEN to PRObabilistically VErify Neural networks with statistical guarantees -- i.e., PROVEN certifies the probability that the classifier's top-1 prediction cannot be altered under any constrained $\\\\ell_p$ norm perturbation to a given input. Importantly, we show that it is possible to derive closed-form probabilistic certificates based on current state-of-the-art neural network robustness verification frameworks. Hence, the probabilistic certificates provided by PROVEN come naturally and with almost no overhead when obtaining the worst-case certified lower bounds from existing methods such as Fast-Lin, CROWN and CNN-Cert. Experiments on small and large MNIST and CIFAR neural network models demonstrate our probabilistic approach can achieve up to around $75\\\\%$ improvement in the robustness certification with at least a $99.99\\\\%$ confidence compared with the worst-case robustness certificate delivered by CROWN.\\n        \",\n",

Although finding minimum adversarial distortion of neural networks (with ReLU activations) has been shown to be an NP-complete problem, obtaining a non-trivial lower bound of minimum distortion as a provable robustness guarantee is possible. However, most previous works only focused on simple fully-connected layers (multilayer perceptrons) and were limited to ReLU activations. This motivates us to propose a general and efficient framework, CNN-Cert, that is capable of certifying robustness on general convolutional neural networks. Our framework is general -- we can handle various architectures including convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, batch normalization layer, residual blocks, as well as general activation functions; our approach is efficient -- by exploiting the special structure of convolutional layers, we achieve up to 17 and 11 times of speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art certification algorithms (e.g. Fast-Lin, CROWN) and 366 times of speed-up compared to the dual-LP approach while our algorithm obtains similar or even better verification bounds. In addition, CNN-Cert generalizes state-of-the-art algorithms e.g. Fast-Lin and CROWN. We demonstrate by extensive experiments that our method outperforms state-of-the-art lower-bound-based certification algorithms in terms of both bound quality and speed.\\n        ',\n",

Nevertheless, recently it has been shown to be possible to give a non-trivial certified lower bound of minimum adversarial distortion, and some recent progress has been made towards this direction by exploiting the piece-wise linear nature of ReLU activations. However, a generic robustness certification for general activation functions still remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce CROWN, a general framework to certify robustness of neural networks with general activation functions for given input data points. The novelty in our algorithm consists of bounding a given activation function with linear and quadratic functions, hence allowing it to tackle general activation functions including but not limited to four popular choices: ReLU, tanh, sigmoid and arctan. In addition, we facilitate the search for a tighter certified lower bound by adaptively selecting appropriate surrogates for each neuron activation. Experimental results show that CROWN on ReLU networks can notably improve the certified lower bounds compared to the current state-of-the-art algorithm Fast-Lin, while having comparable computational efficiency. Furthermore, CROWN also demonstrates its effectiveness and flexibility on networks with general activation functions, including tanh, sigmoid and arctan.\\n        ',\n",

We apply extreme value theory on the new formal robustness guarantee and the estimated robustness is called second-order CLEVER score. Second, we discuss how to handle gradient masking, a common defensive technique, using CLEVER with Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation (BPDA). With BPDA applied, CLEVER can evaluate the intrinsic robustness of neural networks of a broader class -- networks with non-differentiable input transformations.

Current available methods of computing such a bound are either time-consuming or delivering low quality bounds that are too loose to be useful. In this paper, we exploit the special structure of ReLU networks and provide two computationally efficient algorithms Fast-Lin and Fast-Lip that are able to certify non-trivial lower bounds of minimum distortions, by bounding the ReLU units with appropriate linear functions Fast-Lin, or by bounding the local Lipschitz constant Fast-Lip. Experiments show that (1) our proposed methods deliver bounds close to (the gap is 2-3X) exact minimum distortion found by Reluplex in small MNIST networks while our algorithms are more than 10,000 times faster; (2) our methods deliver similar quality of bounds (the gap is within 35% and usually around 10%; sometimes our bounds are even better) for larger networks compared to the methods based on solving linear programming problems but our algorithms are 33-14,000 times faster; (3) our method is capable of solving large MNIST and CIFAR networks up to 7 layers with more than 10,000 neurons within tens of seconds on a single CPU core.\\n  In addition, we show that, in fact, there is no polynomial time algorithm that can approximately find the minimum $\\\\ell_1$ adversarial distortion of a ReLU network with a $0.99\\\\ln n$ approximation ratio unless $\\\\mathsf{NP}$=$\\\\mathsf{P}$, where $n$ is the number of neurons in the network.\\n        ',\n",

We modify the nonintrusive stochastic collocation (SC) method and develop an intrusive variant called stochastic testing (ST) method to accelerate the numerical simulation. Compared with the stochastic Galerkin (SG) method, the resulting coupled deterministic equations from our proposed ST method can be solved in a decoupled manner at each time point. At the same time, ST uses fewer samples and allows more flexible time step size controls than directly using a nonintrusive SC solver. These two properties make ST more efficient than SG and than existing SC methods, and more suitable for time-domain circuit simulation. Simulation results of several digital, analog and RF circuits are reported.

Recent years have also seen big advances in designing multi-item mechanisms. Akin to overfitting, however, these mechanisms can be extremely sensitive to the Bayesian prior that they target, which becomes problematic when that prior is only approximately known. At the same time, even if access to the exact Bayesian prior is given, it is known that optimal or even approximately optimal multi-item mechanisms run into sample, computational, representation and communication intractability barriers.\\n  We consider a natural class of multi-item mechanism design problems with very large numbers of items, but where the bidders' value distributions can be well-approximated by a topic model akin to those used in recommendation systems with very large numbers of possible recommendations. We propose a mechanism design framework for this setting, building on a recent robustification framework by Brustle et al., which disentangles the statistical challenge of estimating a multi-dimensional prior from the task of designing a good mechanism for it, and robustifies the performance of the latter against the estimation error of the former. We provide an extension of this framework appropriate for our setting, which allows us to exploit the expressive power of topic models to reduce the effective dimensionality of the mechanism design problem and remove the dependence of its computational, communication and representation complexity on the number of items.\\n        \",\n",

As our main contribution we provide algorithms and statistically efficient estimation rates for this model, giving several instantiations of our bounds in logistic regression, sparse logistic regression, and neural network settings with dependent data. Our estimation guarantees follow from novel results for estimating the parameters (i.e. external fields and interaction strengths) of Ising models from a {\\\\em single} sample. {We evaluate our estimation approach on real networked data, showing that it outperforms standard regression approaches that ignore dependencies, across three text classification datasets: Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed.}\\n        ',\n",

We show that if both players run policy gradient methods in tandem, their policies will converge to a min-max equilibrium of the game, as long as their learning rates follow a two-timescale rule (which is necessary).

We introduce a new class of structured nonconvex-nonconcave min-max optimization problems, proposing a generalization of the extragradient algorithm which provably converges to a stationary point. The algorithm applies not only to Euclidean spaces, but also to general $\\\\ell_p$-normed finite-dimensional real vector spaces. We also discuss its stability under stochastic oracles and provide bounds on its sample complexity.

Our guarantees hold, in fact, for the celebrated Chow-Liu [1968] algorithm, using the plug-in estimator for estimating mutual information. While this (or any other) algorithm may fail to identify the structure of the underlying model correctly from a finite sample, we show that it will still learn a tree-structured model that is $Œµ$-close to the true one in total variation distance, a guarantee called \"proper learning.\"\\n  Our guarantees do not follow from known results for the Chow-Liu algorithm and the ensuing literature on learning graphical models, including a recent renaissance of algorithms on this learning challenge, which only yield asymptotic consistency results, or sample-inefficient and/or time-inefficient algorithms, unless further assumptions are placed on the graphical model, such as bounds on the \"strengths\" of the model\\'s edges/hyperedges. While we establish guarantees for a widely known and simple algorithm, the analysis that this algorithm succeeds and is sample-optimal is quite complex, requiring a hierarchical classification of the edges into layers with different reconstruction guarantees, depending on their strength, combined with delicate uses of the subadditivity of the squared Hellinger distance over graphical models to control the error accumulation.\\n        ',\n",

This result addresses a question of Mertikopoulos & Zhou (2018), who asked whether extra-gradient approaches (such as OG) can be applied to achieve improved guarantees in the multi-agent learning setting. The proof of our upper bound uses a new technique centered around an adaptive choice of potential function at each iteration. We also show that the $O(1/\\\\sqrt{T})$ rate is tight for all $p$-SCLI algorithms, which includes OG as a special case.

This problem has remained a challenge since the early works of [Tobin 1958, Amemiya 1973, Hausman and Wise 1977], its applications are abundant, and its history dates back even further to the work of Galton, Pearson, Lee, and Fisher. While consistent estimators of the regression coefficients have been identified, the error rates are not well-understood, especially in high dimensions.\\n  Under a thickness assumption about the covariance matrix of the covariates in the revealed sample, we provide a computationally efficient estimator for the coefficient vector $w$ from $n$ revealed samples that attains $l_2$ error $\\\\tilde{O}(\\\\sqrt{k/n})$. Our estimator uses Projected Stochastic Gradient Descent (PSGD) without replacement on the negative log-likelihood of the truncated sample. For the statistically efficient estimation we only need oracle access to the set $S$.In order to achieve computational efficiency we need to assume that $S$ is a union of a finite number of intervals but still can be complicated. PSGD without replacement must be restricted to an appropriately defined convex cone to guarantee that the negative log-likelihood is strongly convex, which in turn is established using concentration of matrices on variables with sub-exponential tails. We perform experiments on simulated data to illustrate the accuracy of our estimator.\\n  As a corollary, we show that SGD learns the parameters of single-layer neural networks with noisy activation functions.\\n        ',\n",

Not only are there no known first-order methods converging even to approximate local min-max points, but the computational complexity of identifying them is also poorly understood. In this paper, we provide a characterization of the computational complexity of the problem, as well as of the limitations of first-order methods in constrained min-max optimization problems with nonconvex-nonconcave objectives and linear constraints.\\n  As a warm-up, we show that, even when the objective is a Lipschitz and smooth differentiable function, deciding whether a min-max point exists, in fact even deciding whether an approximate min-max point exists, is NP-hard. More importantly, we show that an approximate local min-max point of large enough approximation is guaranteed to exist, but finding one such point is PPAD-complete. The same is true of computing an approximate fixed point of Gradient Descent/Ascent.\\n  An important byproduct of our proof is to establish an unconditional hardness result in the Nemirovsky-Yudin model.

This comes in sharp contrast to minimization problems, where finding approximate local minima in the same setting can be done with Projected Gradient Descent using $O(L/\\\\varepsilon)$ many queries. Our result is the first to show an exponential separation between these two fundamental optimization problems.\\n        ',\n",

Particle coordinates at a single time instant, possibly noisy or truncated, are recorded in each snapshot but are unpaired across the snapshots. By training a physics-informed generative model that generates \"fake\" sample paths, we aim to fit the observed particle ensemble distributions with a curve in the probability measure space, which is induced from the inferred particle dynamics. We employ different metrics to quantify the differences between distributions, e.g., the sliced Wasserstein distances and the adversarial losses in generative adversarial networks (GANs). We refer to this method as generative \"ensemble-regression\" (GER), in analogy to the classic \"point-regression\", where we infer the dynamics by performing regression in the Euclidean space. We illustrate the GER by learning the drift and diffusion terms of particle ensembles governed by SODEs with Brownian motions and Levy processes up to 100 dimensions. We also discuss how to treat cases with noisy or truncated observations. Apart from systems consisting of independent particles, we also tackle nonlocal interacting particle systems with unknown interaction potential parameters by constructing a physics-informed loss function. Finally, we investigate scenarios of paired observations and discuss how to reduce the dimensionality in such cases by proving a convergence theorem that provides theoretical support.\\n        ',\n",

As a corollary, our guarantees imply a computationally efficient and information-theoretically optimal algorithm for compressed sensing with truncation, which may arise from measurement saturation effects. Our result follows from a statistical and computational analysis of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm for solving a natural adaptation of the LASSO optimization problem that accommodates truncation. This generalizes the works of both: (1) [Daskalakis et al. 2018], where no regularization is needed due to the low-dimensionality of the data, and (2) [Wainright 2009], where the objective function is simple due to the absence of truncation. In order to deal with both truncation and high-dimensionality at the same time, we develop new techniques that not only generalize the existing ones but we believe are of independent interest.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Generative neural networks have been empirically found very promising in providing effective structural priors for compressed sensing, since they can be trained to span low-dimensional data manifolds in high-dimensional signal spaces. Despite the non-convexity of the resulting optimization problem, it has also been shown theoretically that, for neural networks with random Gaussian weights, a signal in the range of the network can be efficiently, approximately recovered from a few noisy measurements. However, a major bottleneck of these theoretical guarantees is a network expansivity condition: that each layer of the neural network must be larger than the previous by a logarithmic factor. Our main contribution is to break this strong expansivity assumption, showing that constant expansivity suffices to get efficient recovery algorithms, besides it also being information-theoretically necessary. To overcome the theoretical bottleneck in existing approaches we prove a novel uniform concentration theorem for random functions that might not be Lipschitz but satisfy a relaxed notion which we call \"pseudo-Lipschitzness.\" Using this theorem we can show that a matrix concentration inequality known as the Weight Distribution Condition (WDC), which was previously only known to hold for Gaussian matrices with logarithmic aspect ratio, in fact holds for constant aspect ratios too. Since the WDC is a fundamental matrix concentration inequality in the heart of all existing theoretical guarantees on this problem, our tighter bound immediately yields improvements in all known results in the literature on compressed sensing with deep generative priors, including one-bit recovery, phase retrieval, low-rank matrix recovery, and more.\\n        ',\n",

We propose a unified framework that smoothly interpolates between these two settings, enabling significantly richer estimation guarantees from one, a few, or many samples.\\n  Our main theorem provides guarantees for one-sample estimation, quantifying the estimation error in terms of the metric entropy of a family of interaction matrices. As corollaries of our main theorem, we derive bounds when the model's interaction matrix is a (sparse) linear combination of known matrices, or it belongs to a finite set, or to a high-dimensional manifold. In fact, our main result handles multiple independent samples by viewing them as one sample from a larger model, and can be used to derive estimation bounds that are qualitatively similar to those obtained in the afore-described multiple-sample literature. Our technical approach benefits from sparsifying a model's interaction network, conditioning on subsets of variables that make the dependencies in the resulting conditional distribution sufficiently weak.

Conventionally these models have quadratic sufficient statistics and consequently capture correlations arising from pairwise interactions. In this work we study extensions of these to models with higher-order sufficient statistics, modeling behavior on a social network with peer-group effects. In particular, we model binary outcomes on a network as a higher-order spin glass, where the behavior of an individual depends on a linear function of their own vector of covariates and some polynomial function of the behavior of others, capturing peer-group effects. Using a {\\\\em single}, high-dimensional sample from such model our goal is to recover the coefficients of the linear function as well as the strength of the peer-group effects. The heart of our result is a novel approach for showing strong concavity of the log pseudo-likelihood of the model, implying statistical error rate of $\\\\sqrt{d/n}$ for the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE), where $d$ is the dimensionality of the covariate vectors and $n$ is the size of the network (number of nodes).

GANs have been widely used in sample synthesis, de-noising, domain transfer, etc. GANs, however, are designed in a model-free fashion where no additional information about the underlying distribution is available. In many applications, however, practitioners have access to the underlying independence graph of the variables, either as a Bayesian network or a Markov Random Field (MRF). We ask: how can one use this additional information in designing model-based GANs? In this paper, we provide theoretical foundations to answer this question by studying subadditivity properties of probability divergences, which establish upper bounds on the distance between two high-dimensional distributions by the sum of distances between their marginals over (local) neighborhoods of the graphical structure of the Bayes-net or the MRF. We prove that several popular probability divergences satisfy some notion of subadditivity under mild conditions. These results lead to a principled design of a model-based GAN that uses a set of simple discriminators on the neighborhoods of the Bayes-net/MRF, rather than a giant discriminator on the entire network, providing significant statistical and computational benefits. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the benefits of our principled design of model-based GANs.\\n        ',\n",

These entry fees depend only on the prior distribution of bidder types, and in particular are independent of realized bids. We bound the revenue of the resulting two-part tariff mechanism using a novel geometric technique that enables revenue guarantees for many common non-truthful auctions that previously had none. Our approach adapts and extends the duality framework of Cai et al [CDW16] beyond truthful auctions.\\n  Our framework can be used with many common auction formats, such as simultaneous first-price, simultaneous second-price, and simultaneous all-pay auctions. Our results for first price and all-pay are the first revenue guarantees of non-truthful mechanisms in multi-dimensional environments, addressing an open question in the literature [RST17]. If all-pay auctions are used, we prove that the resulting mechanism is also credible in the sense that the auctioneer cannot benefit by deviating from the stated mechanism after observing agent bids. This is the first static credible mechanism for multi-item additive auctions that achieves a constant factor of the optimal revenue. If second-price auctions are used, we obtain a truthful $O(1)$-approximate mechanism with fixed entry fees that are amenable to tuning via online learning techniques.\\n        ',\n",

In this paper, we show that the last iterate of EG converges at a rate of $O(1/\\\\sqrt{T})$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to provide a convergence rate guarantee for the last iterate of EG for the smooth convex-concave saddle point problem.

We show that, given only ``approximate distributions'' for bidder valuations, we can learn a mechanism whose revenue is nearly optimal simultaneously for all ``true distributions'' that are close to the ones we were given in Prokhorov distance. Thus, to learn a good mechanism, it suffices to learn approximate distributions. When item values are independent, learning in Prokhorov distance is immediate, hence our framework directly implies the main result of Gonczarowski and Weinberg. When item values are sampled from more general graphical models, we combine our robustness theorem with novel sample complexity results for learning Markov Random Fields or Bayesian Networks in Prokhorov distance, which may be of independent interest.

Examples abound in financial and meteorological applications, and dependencies naturally arise in social networks through peer effects. Regression with dependent responses has thus received a lot of attention in the Statistics and Economics literature, but there are no strong consistency results unless multiple independent samples of the vectors of dependent responses can be collected from these models. We present computationally and statistically efficient methods for linear and logistic regression models when the response variables are dependent on a network. Given one sample from a networked linear or logistic regression model and under mild assumptions, we prove strong consistency results for recovering the vector of coefficients and the strength of the dependencies, recovering the rates of standard regression under independent observations.

A similar bound holds for any constant power of the Hamming distance. Hence, the expectation of any function that is Lipschitz with respect to a power of the Hamming distance, can be estimated with a bias that grows logarithmically in $n$. Going beyond Lipschitz functions, we consider the bias arising from asynchronicity in estimating the expectation of polynomial functions of all variables in the model. Using recent concentration of measure results, we show that the bias introduced by the asynchronicity is of smaller order than the standard deviation of the function value already present in the true model.

It has been recognized that they may cycle, and there is no good understanding of their limit points when they do not. When they converge, do they converge to local min-max solutions? We characterize the limit points of two basic first order methods, namely Gradient Descent/Ascent (GDA) and Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent (OGDA). We show that both dynamics avoid unstable critical points for almost all initializations. Moreover, for small step sizes and under mild assumptions, the set of \\\\{OGDA\\\\}-stable critical points is a superset of \\\\{GDA\\\\}-stable critical points, which is a superset of local min-max solutions (strict in some cases). The connecting thread is that the behavior of these dynamics can be studied from a dynamical systems perspective.\\n        ',\n",

Traditionally, the design of repeated auctions requires strong modeling assumptions about the bidder behavior, such as it being myopic, infinite lookahead, or some specific form of learning behavior. Is it possible to design mechanisms which are simultaneously optimal against a multitude of possible buyer behaviors? We answer this question by designing a simple state-based mechanism that is simultaneously approximately optimal against a $k$-lookahead buyer for all $k$, a buyer who is a no-regret learner, and a buyer who is a policy-regret learner. Against each type of buyer our mechanism attains a constant fraction of the optimal revenue attainable against that type of buyer. We complement our positive results with almost tight impossibility results, showing that the revenue approximation tradeoffs achieved by our mechanism for different lookahead attitudes are near-optimal.\\n        ',\n",

Our method exploits spanners, i.e. deep neural networks whose input space is low-dimensional and whose output range approximates the set of images of interest. Spanners may be generators of GANs or decoders of VAEs. The key idea in our attack is to search over latent code pairs to find ones that generate nearby images with different classifier outputs. We argue that our attack is stronger than searching over perturbations of real images. Moreover, we show that our stronger attack can be used to reduce the accuracy of Defense-GAN to 3\\\\%, resolving an open problem from the well-known paper by Athalye et al. We combine our attack with normal adversarial training to obtain the most robust known MNIST classifier, significantly improving the state of the art against PGD attacks. Our formulation involves solving a min-max problem, where the min player sets the parameters of the classifier and the max player is running our attack, and is thus searching for adversarial examples in the {\\\\em low-dimensional} input space of the spanner.\\n  All code and models are available at \\\\url{https://github.com/ajiljalal/manifold-defense.git}\\n        ',\n",

Recent theoretical results have shown that optimistic mirror decent (OMD) can enjoy faster regret rates in the context of zero-sum games. WGANs is exactly a context of solving a zero-sum game with simultaneous no-regret dynamics. Moreover, we show that optimistic mirror decent addresses the limit cycling problem in training WGANs. We formally show that in the case of bi-linear zero-sum games the last iterate of OMD dynamics converges to an equilibrium, in contrast to GD dynamics which are bound to cycle. We also portray the huge qualitative difference between GD and OMD dynamics with toy examples, even when GD is modified with many adaptations proposed in the recent literature, such as gradient penalty or momentum. We apply OMD WGAN training to a bioinformatics problem of generating DNA sequences. We observe that models trained with OMD achieve consistently smaller KL divergence with respect to the true underlying distribution, than models trained with GD variants. Finally, we introduce a new algorithm, Optimistic Adam, which is an optimistic variant of Adam. We apply it to WGAN training on CIFAR10 and observe improved performance in terms of inception score as compared to Adam.\\n        ',\n",

We obtain our learning results in two settings. The first is the commonly studied setting where sample access to the bidders\\' distributions over valuations is given, for both regular distributions and arbitrary distributions with bounded support. Our algorithms require polynomially many samples in the number of items and bidders. The second is a more general max-min learning setting that we introduce, where we are given \"approximate distributions,\" and we seek to compute an auction whose revenue is approximately optimal simultaneously for all \"true distributions\" that are close to the given ones. These results are more general in that they imply the sample-based results, and are also applicable in settings where we have no sample access to the underlying distributions but have estimated them indirectly via market research or by observation of previously run, potentially non-truthful auctions.\\n  Our results hold for valuation distributions satisfying the standard (and necessary) independence-across-items property. They also generalize and improve upon recent works, which have provided algorithms that learn approximately optimal auctions in more restricted settings with additive, subadditive and unit-demand valuations using sample access to distributions. We generalize these results to the complete unit-demand, additive, and XOS setting, to i.i.d. subadditive bidders, and to the max-min setting.\\n  Our results are enabled by new uniform convergence bounds for hypotheses classes under product measures.

However, in recent work, the following questions have been been critical to solving problems at the frontiers of distribution testing:\\n  -Alternative Distances: Can we test whether $p$ and $q$ are far in other distances, say Hellinger?\\n  -Tolerance: Can we test when $p$ and $q$ are close, rather than equal? And if so, close in which distances?\\n  Motivated by these questions, we characterize the complexity of distribution testing under a variety of distances, including total variation, $\\\\ell_2$, Hellinger, Kullback-Leibler, and $œá^2$. For each pair of distances $d_1$ and $d_2$, we study the complexity of testing if $p$ and $q$ are close in $d_1$ versus far in $d_2$, with a focus on identifying which problems allow strongly sublinear testers (i.e., those with complexity $O(n^{1 - Œ≥})$ for some $Œ≥> 0$ where $n$ is the size of the support of the distributions $p$ and $q$). We provide matching upper and lower bounds for each case. We also study these questions in the case where we only have samples from $q$ (equivalence testing), showing qualitative differences from identity testing in terms of when tolerance can be achieved. Our algorithms fall into the classical paradigm of $œá^2$-statistics, but require crucial changes to handle the challenges introduced by each distance we consider.

Given our single trajectory, the goal is to test whether M is identical to a model Markov Chain M0 , or far from it under an appropriate notion of difference. We propose a measure of difference between two Markov chains, motivated by the early work of Kazakos [Kaz78], which captures the scaling behavior of the total variation distance between trajectories sampled from the Markov chains as the length of these trajectories grows. We provide efficient testers and information-theoretic lower bounds for testing identity of symmetric Markov chains under our proposed measure of difference, which are tight up to logarithmic factors if the hitting times of the model chain M0 is O(n) in the size of the state space n.\\n        ',\n",

For each of these variants, and many of the subsets of $\\\\{+,-,\\\\times,√∑\\\\}$, we prove the problem NP-complete, sometimes in the weak sense and sometimes in the strong sense.

Configurations with the forbidden pattern do have disconnected reconfiguration graphs (discrete configuration spaces), and indeed we show that they can have an exponential number of connected components. But forbidding the local pattern throughout the configuration is far from necessary, as we show that just a constant number of added modules (placed to be freely reconfigurable) suffice for universal reconfigurability.

Thus, circles (eccentricity 0) and parabolas (eccentricity 1) are compatible with only themselves (when scaled from a focus), and ellipses (eccentricity strictly between 0 and 1) and hyperbolas (eccentricity above 1) are compatible with themselves and each other (but only in specific pairings).

Unlike flat foldability of origami or flexibility of other kinematic linkages, whose complexity originates in the complexity of the layer ordering and possible self-intersection of the material, rigid foldability from a planar state is hard even though there is no potential self-intersection. In fact, the complexity comes from the combinatorial behavior of the different possible rigid folding configurations at each vertex. The results underpin the fact that it is harder to fold from an unfolded sheet of paper than to unfold a folded state back to a plane, frequently encountered problem when realizing folding-based systems such as self-folding matter and reconfigurable robots.\\n        ',\n",

In all puzzles, the goal is to draw a simple path in a rectangular grid graph from a start vertex to a destination vertex. The different puzzle types place different constraints on the path: preventing some edges from being visited (broken edges); forcing some edges or vertices to be visited (hexagons); forcing some cells to have certain numbers of incident path edges (triangles); or forcing the regions formed by the path to be partially monochromatic (squares), have exactly two special cells (stars), or be singly covered by given shapes (polyominoes) and/or negatively counting shapes (antipolyominoes). We show that any one of these clue types (except the first) is enough to make path finding NP-complete (\"witnesses exist but are hard to find\"), even for rectangular boards. Furthermore, we show that a final clue type (antibody), which necessarily \"cancels\" the effect of another clue in the same region, makes path finding $Œ£_2$-complete (\"witnesses do not exist\"), even with a single antibody (combined with many anti/polyominoes), and the problem gets no harder with many antibodies.

These overheads are a major barrier to FHE's widespread adoption. We present F1, the first FHE accelerator that is programmable, i.e., capable of executing full FHE programs. F1 builds on an in-depth architectural analysis of the characteristics of FHE computations that reveals acceleration opportunities. F1 is a wide-vector processor with novel functional units deeply specialized to FHE primitives, such as modular arithmetic, number-theoretic transforms, and structured permutations. This organization provides so much compute throughput that data movement becomes the bottleneck. Thus, F1 is primarily designed to minimize data movement. The F1 hardware provides an explicitly managed memory hierarchy and mechanisms to decouple data movement from execution. A novel compiler leverages these mechanisms to maximize reuse and schedule off-chip and on-chip data movement. We evaluate F1 using cycle-accurate simulations and RTL synthesis. F1 is the first system to accelerate complete FHE programs and outperforms state-of-the-art software implementations by gmean 5400x and by up to 17000x.

To better understand this type of challenges, we provide in this paper a comprehensive study of DP-SCO under various settings.

However, analytics workloads are often bursty or low volume, leaving clusters idle much of the time, meaning customers pay for compute resources even when unused. The ability of cloud function services, such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions, to run small, fine granularity tasks make them appear to be a natural choice for query processing in such settings. But implementing an analytics system on cloud functions comes with its own set of challenges. These include managing hundreds of tiny stateless resource-constrained workers, handling stragglers, and shuffling data through opaque cloud services. In this paper we present Starling, a query execution engine built on cloud function services that employs number of techniques to mitigate these challenges, providing interactive query latency at a lower total cost than provisioned systems with low-to-moderate utilization. In particular, on a 1TB TPC-H dataset in cloud storage, Starling is less expensive than the best provisioned systems for workloads when queries arrive 1 minute apart or more.

Employing a data-oriented approach allows the core challenge (i.e., managing and coordinating a large set of distributed computing resources) to be transformed from a relatively low-level systems problem into a more abstract, higher-level data management problem. Preliminary results suggest that CondorJ2's use of standard 3-tier software represents a significant step forward to the design and implementation of large clusters (1,000 to 10,000 nodes).\\n        \",\n",

The need to publish and share data and the need for generic analysis and visualization tools will finally create a convergence on common metadata standards. Database systems will be judged by their support of these metadata standards and by their ability to manage and access peta-scale datasets.

However, these proposals are single points in a large and diverse design space. The lack of systematic description and modeling support for these sparse tensor accelerators impedes hardware designers from efficient and effective design space exploration. This paper first presents a unified taxonomy to systematically describe the diverse sparse tensor accelerator design space. Based on the proposed taxonomy, it then introduces Sparseloop, the first fast, accurate, and flexible analytical modeling framework to enable early-stage evaluation and exploration of sparse tensor accelerators. Sparseloop comprehends a large set of architecture specifications, including various dataflows and sparse acceleration features (e.g., elimination of zero-based compute). Using these specifications, Sparseloop evaluates a design's processing speed and energy efficiency while accounting for data movement and compute incurred by the employed dataflow as well as the savings and overhead introduced by the sparse acceleration features using stochastic tensor density models. Across representative accelerators and workloads, Sparseloop achieves over 2000 times faster modeling speed than cycle-level simulations, maintains relative performance trends, and achieves 0.1% to 8% average error. With a case study, we demonstrate Sparseloop's ability to help reveal important insights for designing sparse tensor accelerators (e.g., it is important to co-design orthogonal design aspects).\\n        \",\n",

Existing approaches that rely on low-level simulations with fault injection cannot evaluate full applications because of their slow speeds, while application-level accelerated fault testing in accelerated particle beams is often impractical. We present a new two-level methodology for application resilience evaluation that overcomes these challenges. The proposed approach decomposes application failure rate estimation into (1) identifying how particle strikes in low-level unprotected state manifest at the architecture-level, and (2) measuring how such architecture-level manifestations propagate to the program output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on GPU architectures.

These compact or sparse models are different from the traditional large ones in that there is much more variation in their layer shapes and sizes, and often require specialized hardware to exploit sparsity for performance improvement. Thus, many DNN accelerators designed for large DNNs do not perform well on these models. In this work, we present Eyeriss v2, a DNN accelerator architecture designed for running compact and sparse DNNs. To deal with the widely varying layer shapes and sizes, it introduces a highly flexible on-chip network, called hierarchical mesh, that can adapt to the different amounts of data reuse and bandwidth requirements of different data types, which improves the utilization of the computation resources. Furthermore, Eyeriss v2 can process sparse data directly in the compressed domain for both weights and activations, and therefore is able to improve both processing speed and energy efficiency with sparse models. Overall, with sparse MobileNet, Eyeriss v2 in a 65nm CMOS process achieves a throughput of 1470.6 inferences/sec and 2560.3 inferences/J at a batch size of 1, which is 12.6x faster and 2.5x more energy efficient than the original Eyeriss running MobileNet.

Specifically, SCNN employs a novel dataflow that enables maintaining the sparse weights and activations in a compressed encoding, which eliminates unnecessary data transfers and reduces storage requirements. Furthermore, the SCNN dataflow facilitates efficient delivery of those weights and activations to the multiplier array, where they are extensively reused. In addition, the accumulation of multiplication products are performed in a novel accumulator array.

Each of two memories, connected by an optical channel, emits a photonic qubit entangled with itself, and the photonic qubits undergo an entanglement swap on a beamsplitter in the middle of the channel. We compare two choices of encoding of the photonic qubit: the single rail and dual rail. In the regime of low channel loss, i.e., when the loss of the half-channel connecting one memory site to the swap site is less than $\\\\approx 6$ dB, the dual-rail scheme is seen to outperform the single rail scheme. The high-loss rate asymptote for the dual rail scheme is worse: it scales as $O(Œ∑)$ ebits per transmitted photonic mode, as opposed to $O(\\\\sqrtŒ∑)$ for the single-rail scheme, where $\\\\sqrtŒ∑$ is the transmissivity of the half channel. Considering the following non-idealities: imperfect mode matching at the swap, carrier-phase mismatch across the interfered photonic qubits from the two sides, and detector excess noise, we evaluate the explicit density operator of the heralded two-qubit entangled state. We calculate a lower bound on its distillable entanglement per copy, and its Fidelity (with the ideal Bell state). Imperfect swap-visibility results in a constant-factor decrease in the rate, while excess noise results in a sharp dropoff of distillable entanglement beyond a certain total channel loss threshold to zero. Despite the single-rail scheme's better rate-loss scaling, it is more severely affected by excess noise, and is adversely affected by stochastic carrier-phase mismatch. We study entanglement distillation on the heralded noisy entangled states. Our evaluation of the density operator of the entangled state will hopefully pave the way for more realistic performance evaluations of larger quantum networks and the development of advanced entanglement distillation schemes.\\n        \",\n",

Here we address this problem by introducing an alignment-free photonic coupler robust to x, y, z displacement and angular misalignment. This alignment-free coupler engineers a translationally-invariant evanescent interaction between waveguides by intersecting them at an angle, which enables a lateral and angular alignment tolerance fundamentally larger than non-evanescent approaches such as edge coupling. We show that our approach can function as a universal photonic connector interfacing photonic integrated circuits and microchiplets across different platforms.

Because these designs allow for perfect realization of the cross state, the matrix fidelity no longer decreases with mesh size, allowing scaling to arbitrarily large meshes. The proposed architectures support progressive self-configuration, are more compact than previous MZI-doubling schemes, and do not require additional phase shifters.

We demonstrate a solid-state sensor employing a non-optical state preparation technique, which harnesses thermal population imbalances induced by the defect's zero-field splitting. Readout is performed using the recently-demonstrated microwave cavity readout technique, resulting in a sensor architecture that is entirely non-optical and broadly applicable to all solid-state paramagnetic defects with a zero-field splitting. The implementation in this work uses Cr$^{3+}$ defects in a sapphire (Al$_2$O$_3$) crystal and a simple microwave architecture where the host crystal also serves as the high quality-factor resonator.

       " '\\n        Integrating and manipulating the nano-optoelectronic properties of Van der Waals heterostructures can enable unprecedented platforms for photodetection and sensing. The main challenge of infrared photodetectors is to funnel the light into a small nanoscale active area and efficiently convert it into an electrical signal. Here, we overcome all of those challenges in one device, by efficient coupling of a plasmonic antenna to hyperbolic phonon-polaritons in hexagonal-BN to highly concentrate mid-infrared light into a graphene pn-junction. We balance the interplay of the absorption, electrical and thermal conductivity of graphene via the device geometry. This novel approach yields remarkable device performance featuring room temperature high sensitivity (NEP of 82 pW-per-square-root-Hz) and fast rise time of 17 nanoseconds (setup-limited), among others, hence achieving a combination currently not present in the state-of-the-art graphene and commercial mid-infrared detectors. We also develop a multiphysics model that shows excellent quantitative agreement with our experimental results and reveals the different contributions to our photoresponse, thus paving the way for further improvement of these types of photodetectors even beyond mid-infrared range.\\n        ',\n",

Stellar population and dust maps are constructed from the high-resolution CANDELS/3D-HST multi-band imaging. Rather than constructing the layout of resolved elements (i.e., Voronoi bins) from the S/N distribution of the $H_{160}$-band alone, we introduce a modified Voronoi binning method that additionally incorporates the S/N distribution of several resolved filters. The SED-derived resolved E(B-V)$_{\\\\text{stars}}$, stellar population ages, SFRs, and stellar masses that are inferred from the Voronoi bins constructed from multiple filters are generally consistent with the properties inferred from the integrated photometry within the uncertainties, with the exception of the inferred E(B-V)$_{\\\\text{stars}}$ from our $z\\\\sim1.5$ sample due to their UV slopes being unconstrained by the resolved photometry. The results from our multi-filter Voronoi binning technique are compared to those derived from a \"traditional\" single-filter Voronoi binning approach. We find that single-filter binning produces inferred E(B-V)$_{\\\\text{stars}}$ that are systematically redder by 0.02 mag on average, but could differ by up to 0.20 mag, and could be attributed to poorly constrained resolved photometry covering the UV slope. Overall, we advocate that our methodology produces more reliable SED-derived parameters due to the best-fit resolved SEDs being better constrained at all resolved wavelengths--particularly those covering the UV slope.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        We present results from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey on broad flux from the nebular emission lines H$Œ±$, [NII], [OIII], H$Œ≤$, and [SII]. The sample consists of 127 star-forming galaxies at $1.37 < z < 2.61$ and 84 galaxies at $2.95 < z < 3.80$. We decompose the emission lines using narrow ($\\\\text{FWHM} < 275 \\\\ \\\\text{km s}^{-1}$) and broad ($\\\\text{FWHM} > 300 \\\\ \\\\text{km s}^{-1}$) Gaussian components for individual galaxies and stacks. Broad emission is detected at $>3œÉ$ in $<10$% of galaxies and the broad flux accounts for 10-70% of the total flux. We find a slight increase in broad to narrow flux ratio with mass but note that we cannot reliably detect broad emission with $\\\\text{FWHM} < 275 \\\\ \\\\text{km s}^{-1}$, which may be significant at low masses. Notably, there is a correlation between higher signal-to-noise (S/N) spectra and a broad component detection indicating a S/N dependence in our ability to detect broad flux. When placed on the N2-BPT diagram ([OIII]/H$Œ≤$ vs. [NII]/H$Œ±$) the broad components of the stacks are shifted towards higher [OIII]/H$Œ≤$ and [NII]/$Œ±$ ratios compared to the narrow component. We compare the location of the broad components to shock models and find that the broad component could be due to shocks, but we do not rule out other possibilities such as the presence of an AGN. We estimate the mass loading factor (mass outflow rate/star formation rate) assuming the broad component is a photoionized outflow and find that the mass loading factor increases as a function of mass which agrees with previous studies. We show that adding emission from shocked gas to $z\\\\sim0$ SDSS spectra shifts galaxies towards the location of $z\\\\sim2$ galaxies on several emission line diagnostic diagrams.\\n        ',\n",

The AGN have bolometric luminosities of $\\\\sim10^{44}-10^{46} ~\\\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$, including both quasars and moderate-luminosity AGN. We detect blueshifted, ionized gas outflows in the H$Œ≤$ , [OIII], H$Œ±$ ~and/or [NII] emission lines of $19\\\\%$ of the AGN, while only 1.8\\\\% of the MOSDEF galaxies have similarly-detected outflows. The outflow velocities span $\\\\sim$300 to 1000 km s$^{-1}$. Eight of the 13 outflows are spatially extended on similar scales as the host galaxies, with spatial extents of 2.5 to 11.0 kpc. Outflows are detected uniformly across the star-forming main sequence, showing little trend with the host galaxy SFR. Line ratio diagnostics indicate that the outflowing gas is photoionized by the AGN. We do not find evidence for positive AGN feedback, in either our small MOSDEF sample or a much larger SDSS sample, using the BPT diagram. Given that a galaxy with an AGN is ten times more likely to have a detected outflow, the outflowing gas is photoionzed by the AGN, and estimates of the mass and energy outflow rates indicate that stellar feedback is insufficient to drive at least some of these outflows, they are very likely to be AGN-driven. The outflows have mass-loading factors of the order of unity, suggesting that they help regulate star formation in their host galaxies, though they may be insufficient to fully quench it.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        We present results on the variation of 7.7 micron Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission in galaxies spanning a wide range in metallicity at z ~ 2. For this analysis, we use rest-frame optical spectra of 476 galaxies at 1.37 < z < 2.61 from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey to infer metallicities and ionization states. Spitzer/MIPS 24 micron and Herschel/PACS 100 and 160 micron observations are used to derive rest-frame 7.7 micron luminosities (L(7.7)) and total IR luminosities (L(IR)), respectively. We find significant trends between the ratio of L(7.7) to L(IR) (and to dust-corrected SFR) and both metallicity and [OIII]/[OII] (O32) emission-line ratio. The latter is an empirical proxy for the ionization parameter. These trends indicate a paucity of PAH emission in low metallicity environments with harder and more intense radiation fields. Additionally, L(7.7)/L(IR) is significantly lower in the youngest quartile of our sample (ages of 500 Myr) compared to older galaxies, which may be a result of the delayed production of PAHs by AGB stars. The relative strength of L(7.7) to L(IR) is also lower by a factor of ~ 2 for galaxies with masses $M_* < 10^{10}M_{\\\\odot}$, compared to the more massive ones. We demonstrate that commonly-used conversions of L(7.7) (or 24 micron flux density; f(24)) to L(IR) underestimate the IR luminosity by more than a factor of 2 at $M_*$ ~ $10^{9.6-10.0} M_{\\\\odot}$. We adopt a mass-dependent conversion of L(7.7) to L(IR) with L(7.7)/L(IR)= 0.09 and 0.22 for $M_* < 10^{10}$ and $> 10^{10} M_{\\\\odot}$, respectively. Based on the new scaling, the SFR-$M_*$ relation has a shallower slope than previously derived. Our results also suggest a higher IR luminosity density at z ~ 2 than previously measured, corresponding to a ~ 30% increase in the SFR density.\\n        ',\n",

       " '\\n        Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a micrometer-scale, volumetric imaging modality that has become a clinical standard in ophthalmology. OCT instruments image by raster-scanning a focused light spot across the retina, acquiring sequential cross-sectional images to generate volumetric data. Patient eye motion during the acquisition poses unique challenges: Non-rigid, discontinuous distortions can occur, leading to gaps in data and distorted topographic measurements. We present a new distortion model and a corresponding fully-automatic, reference-free optimization strategy for computational motion correction in orthogonally raster-scanned, retinal OCT volumes. Using a novel, domain-specific spatiotemporal parametrization of forward-warping displacements, eye motion can be corrected continuously for the first time. Parameter estimation with temporal regularization improves robustness and accuracy over previous spatial approaches. We correct each A-scan individually in 3D in a single mapping, including repeated acquisitions used in OCT angiography protocols. Specialized 3D forward image warping reduces median runtime to < 9 s, fast enough for clinical use. We present a quantitative evaluation on 18 subjects with ocular pathology and demonstrate accurate correction during microsaccades. Transverse correction is limited only by ocular tremor, whereas submicron repeatability is achieved axially (0.51 um median of medians), representing a dramatic improvement over previous work. This allows assessing longitudinal changes in focal retinal pathologies as a marker of disease progression or treatment response, and promises to enable multiple new capabilities such as supersampled/super-resolution volume reconstruction and analysis of pathological eye motion occuring in neurological diseases.\\n        ',\n",

The cut-matching game provided in this paper is crucial in extending this versatile and powerful machinery to constant-hop expanders.

Many distributed systems are built on top of an underlying networking infrastructure, for example by using a virtual communication topology known as an overlay network. Although this underlying network might allow each node to directly communicate with a large number of other nodes, the amount of communication that a node can perform in a fixed amount of time is typically much more limited. We introduce the Node-Capacitated Clique model as an abstract communication model, which allows us to study the effect of nodes having limited communication capacity on the complexity of distributed graph computations. In this model, the $n$ nodes of a network are connected as a clique and communicate in synchronous rounds. In each round, every node can exchange messages of $O(\\\\log n)$ bits with at most $O(\\\\log n)$ other nodes. When solving a graph problem, the input graph $G$ is defined on the same set of $n$ nodes, where each node knows which other nodes are its neighbors in $G$. To initiate research on the Node-Capacitated Clique model, we present distributed algorithms for the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), BFS Tree, Maximal Independent Set, Maximal Matching, and Vertex Coloring problems. We show that even with only $O(\\\\log n)$ concurrent interactions per node, the MST problem can still be solved in polylogarithmic time.

A standard measure that captures sparsity is arboricity, which is the smallest number of forests into which the edges of the graph can be partitioned.\\n  We present simple randomized distributed algorithms that, with high probability, color any $n$-node $Œ±$-arboricity graph:\\n  - using $(2+\\\\varepsilon)\\\\cdot Œ±$ colors, for constant $\\\\varepsilon>0$, in $O(\\\\log n)$ rounds, if $Œ±=\\\\tildeŒ©(\\\\log n)$, or\\n  - using $O(Œ±\\\\log Œ±)$ colors, in $O(\\\\log n)$ rounds, or\\n  - using $O(Œ±)$ colors, in $O(\\\\log n \\\\cdot \\\\min\\\\{\\\\log\\\\log n,\\\\; \\\\log Œ±\\\\})$ rounds.\\n  These algorithms are nearly-optimal, as it is known by results of Linial [FOCS'87] and Barenboim and Elkin [PODC'08] that coloring with $Œò(Œ±)$ colors, or even poly$(Œ±)$ colors, requires $Œ©(\\\\log_Œ± n)$ rounds. The previously best-known $O(\\\\log n)$-time result was a deterministic algorithm due to Barenboim and Elkin [PODC'08], which uses $Œò(Œ±^2)$ colors.

It is widely known that for many of the classic distributed graph problems (including maximal independent set (MIS) and $(Œî+1)$-vertex coloring), the randomized complexity is at most polylogarithmic in the size $n$ of the network, while the best deterministic complexity is typically $2^{O(\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n})}$. Understanding and narrowing down this exponential gap is considered to be one of the central long-standing open questions in the area of distributed graph algorithms. We investigate the problem by introducing a complexity-theoretic framework that allows us to shed some light on the role of randomness in the LOCAL model. We define the SLOCAL model as a sequential version of the LOCAL model. Our framework allows us to prove completeness results with respect to the class of problems which can be solved efficiently in the SLOCAL model, implying that if any of the complete problems can be solved deterministically in $\\\\log^{O(1)} n$ rounds in the LOCAL model, we can deterministically solve all efficient SLOCAL-problems (including MIS and $(Œî+1)$-coloring) in $\\\\log^{O(1)} n$ rounds in the LOCAL model. We show that a rather rudimentary looking graph coloring problem is complete in the above sense: Color the nodes of a graph with colors red and blue such that each node of sufficiently large polylogarithmic degree has at least one neighbor of each color. The problem admits a trivial zero-round randomized solution. The result can be viewed as showing that the only obstacle to getting efficient determinstic algorithms in the LOCAL model is an efficient algorithm to approximately round fractional values into integer values.\\n        \",\n",

Our model also includes two new parameterized generalizations: (1) the network topology can undergo a bounded rate of change (for a parameterized rate that spans from no changes to changes in every round); and (2) in each round, each node can advertise a bounded amount of information to all of its neighbors before connection decisions are made (for a parameterized number of bits that spans from no advertisement to large advertisements). We prove that in the mobile telephone model with no advertisements and no topology changes, PUSH-PULL style algorithms perform poorly with respect to a graph's vertex expansion and graph conductance as compared to the known tight results in the classical telephone model. We then prove, however, that if nodes are allowed to advertise a single bit in each round, a natural variation of PUSH-PULL terminates in time that matches (within logarithmic factors) this strategy's performance in the classical telephone model---even in the presence of frequent topology changes. We also analyze how the performance of this algorithm degrades as the rate of change increases toward the maximum possible amount. We argue that our model matches well the properties of emerging peer-to-peer communication standards for mobile devices, and that our efficient PUSH-PULL variation that leverages small advertisements and adapts well to topology changes is a good choice for rumor spreading in this increasingly important setting.\\n        \",\n",

To approach this problem, we introduce General Retrieval Adaptors for Continual Editing, or GRACE, which learns to cache a chosen layer's activations in an adaptive codebook as edits stream in, leaving original model weights frozen. GRACE can thus edit models thousands of times in a row using only streaming errors, without influencing unrelated inputs.

Attributing model performance changes to specific shifts is critical for identifying sources of model failures, and for taking mitigating actions that ensure robust models. In this work, we introduce the problem of attributing performance differences between environments to distribution shifts in the underlying data generating mechanisms. We formulate the problem as a cooperative game where the players are distributions. We define the value of a set of distributions to be the change in model performance when only this set of distributions has changed between environments, and derive an importance weighting method for computing the value of an arbitrary set of distributions. The contribution of each distribution to the total performance change is then quantified as its Shapley value.

Motivated by the limited settings in which existing measures can be applied, we propose a novel complexity measure based on the local manifold smoothness of a classifier. We define local manifold smoothness as a classifier's output sensitivity to perturbations in the manifold neighborhood around a given test point. Intuitively, a classifier that is less sensitive to these perturbations should generalize better. To estimate smoothness we sample points using data augmentation and measure the fraction of these points classified into the majority class. Our method only requires selecting a data augmentation method and makes no other assumptions about the model or data distributions, meaning it can be applied even in out-of-domain (OOD) settings where existing methods cannot. In experiments on robustness benchmarks in image classification, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference, we demonstrate a strong and robust correlation between our manifold smoothness measure and actual OOD generalization on over 3,000 models evaluated on over 100 train/test domain pairs.\\n        \",\n",

Our work makes three key contributions. First, we find that models can identify patient self-reported race from clinical notes even when the notes are stripped of explicit indicators of race. Second, we determine that human experts are not able to accurately predict patient race from the same redacted clinical notes.

In this work, we audit the quality of such explanations for different protected subgroups using real data from four settings in finance, healthcare, college admissions, and the US justice system. Across two different blackbox model architectures and four popular explainability methods, we find that the approximation quality of explanation models, also known as the fidelity, differs significantly between subgroups. We also demonstrate that pairing explainability methods with recent advances in robust machine learning can improve explanation fairness in some settings.

However, prior work has found that such classifiers can exhibit biases in the form of gaps in predictive performance across protected groups. In this paper, we question whether striving to achieve zero disparities in predictive performance (i.e. group fairness) is the appropriate fairness definition in the clinical setting, over minimax fairness, which focuses on maximizing the performance of the worst-case group. We benchmark the performance of nine methods in improving classifier fairness across these two definitions. We find, consistent with prior work on non-clinical data, that methods which strive to achieve better worst-group performance do not outperform simple data balancing. We also find that methods which achieve group fairness do so by worsening performance for all groups. In light of these results, we discuss the utility of fairness definitions in the clinical setting, advocating for an investigation of the bias-inducing mechanisms in the underlying data generating process whenever possible.\\n        ',\n",

However, many applications of great importance, including healthcare, do not satisfy this assumption, yet they are commonly modelled as MDPs after an artificial reshaping of the data. In addition, most healthcare (and similar) problems are offline by nature, allowing for only retrospective studies. To address both challenges, we begin by discussing the Semi-MDP (SMDP) framework, which formally handles actions of variable timings. We next present a formal way to apply SMDP modifications to nearly any given value-based offline RL method. We use this theory to introduce three SMDP-based offline RL algorithms, namely, SDQN, SDDQN, and SBCQ. We then experimentally demonstrate that only these SMDP-based algorithms learn the optimal policy in variable-time environments, whereas their MDP counterparts do not. Finally, we apply our new algorithms to a real-world offline dataset pertaining to warfarin dosing for stroke prevention and demonstrate similar results.\\n        ',\n",

In this paper, we present a method to learn checklists for clinical decision support. We represent predictive checklists as discrete linear classifiers with binary features and unit weights. We then learn globally optimal predictive checklists from data by solving an integer programming problem. Our method allows users to customize checklists to obey complex constraints, including constraints to enforce group fairness and to binarize real-valued features at training time. In addition, it pairs models with an optimality gap that can inform model development and determine the feasibility of learning sufficiently accurate checklists on a given dataset. We pair our method with specialized techniques that speed up its ability to train a predictive checklist that performs well and has a small optimality gap. We benchmark the performance of our method on seven clinical classification problems, and demonstrate its practical benefits by training a short-form checklist for PTSD screening. Our results show that our method can fit simple predictive checklists that perform well and that can easily be customized to obey a rich class of custom constraints.\\n        ',\n",

These surface cues, as the ``shortcuts'' inherent in the datasets, do not contribute to the *task-specific information* (TSI) of the classification tasks. While it is essential to look at the model performance, it is also important to understand the datasets. In this paper, we consider this question: Apart from the information introduced by the shortcut features, how much task-specific information is required to classify a dataset? We formulate this quantity in an information-theoretic framework. While this quantity is hard to compute, we approximate it with a fast and stable method. TSI quantifies the amount of linguistic knowledge modulo a set of predefined shortcuts -- that contributes to classifying a sample from each dataset. This framework allows us to compare across datasets, saying that, apart from a set of ``shortcut features'', classifying each sample in the Multi-NLI task involves around 0.4 nats more TSI than in the Quora Question Pair.\\n        \",\n",

In data-constrained offline settings, both approaches may fail as they assume fully optimal behavior or rely on exploring alternatives that may not exist. We introduce an inherently different approach that identifies possible \"dead-ends\" of a state space. We focus on the condition of patients in the intensive care unit, where a \"medical dead-end\" indicates that a patient will expire, regardless of all potential future treatment sequences. We postulate \"treatment security\" as avoiding treatments with probability proportional to their chance of leading to dead-ends, present a formal proof, and frame discovery as an RL problem. We then train three independent deep neural models for automated state construction, dead-end discovery and confirmation. Our empirical results discover that dead-ends exist in real clinical data among septic patients, and further reveal gaps between secure treatments and those that were administered.\\n        ',\n",

Such models cannot be trusted in deployment environments to provide accurate predictions. While viewing the problem from a causal lens is known to be useful, the seamless integration of causation techniques into machine learning pipelines remains cumbersome and expensive. In this work, we study and extend a causal pre-training debiasing technique called causal bootstrapping (CB) under five practical confounded-data generation-acquisition scenarios (with known and unknown confounding). Under these settings, we systematically investigate the effect of confounding bias on deep learning model performance, demonstrating their propensity to rely on shortcut biases when these biases are not properly accounted for. We demonstrate that such a causal pre-training technique can significantly outperform existing base practices to mitigate confounding bias on real-world domain generalization benchmarking tasks. This systematic investigation underlines the importance of accounting for the underlying data-generating mechanisms and fortifying data-preprocessing pipelines with a causal framework to develop methods robust to confounding biases.\\n        ',\n",

We conduct a large-scale empirical study of DRO and several variations of standard learning procedures to identify approaches for model development and selection that consistently improve disaggregated and worst-case performance over subpopulations compared to standard approaches for learning predictive models from electronic health records data. In the course of our evaluation, we introduce an extension to DRO approaches that allows for specification of the metric used to assess worst-case performance. We conduct the analysis for models that predict in-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay, and 30-day readmission for inpatient admissions, and predict in-hospital mortality using intensive care data. We find that, with relatively few exceptions, no approach performs better, for each patient subpopulation examined, than standard learning procedures using the entire training dataset. These results imply that when it is of interest to improve model performance for patient subpopulations beyond what can be achieved with standard practices, it may be necessary to do so via data collection techniques that increase the effective sample size or reduce the level of noise in the prediction problem.\\n        ',\n",

Our findings hold under external validation conditions, as well as when models are optimized to perform clinically motivated tasks. We demonstrate this detection is not due to trivial proxies or imaging-related surrogate covariates for race, such as underlying disease distribution. Finally, we show that performance persists over all anatomical regions and frequency spectrum of the images suggesting that mitigation efforts will be challenging and demand further study.\\n  Interpretation: We emphasize that model ability to predict self-reported race is itself not the issue of importance. However, our findings that AI can trivially predict self-reported race -- even from corrupted, cropped, and noised medical images -- in a setting where clinical experts cannot, creates an enormous risk for all model deployments in medical imaging: if an AI model secretly used its knowledge of self-reported race to misclassify all Black patients, radiologists would not be able to tell using the same data the model has access to.\\n        ',\n",

We introduce a framework to induce synthetic but realistic domain shifts and sampling bias to stress-test these methods over existing non-healthcare benchmarks. We find that current domain generalization methods do not consistently achieve significant gains in out-of-distribution performance over empirical risk minimization on real-world medical imaging data, in line with prior work on general imaging datasets.

To date, how best to construct such states in a healthcare setting is an open question. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of several information encoding architectures using data from septic patients in the MIMIC-III dataset to form representations of a patient state. We evaluate the impact of representation dimension, correlations with established acuity scores, and the treatment policies derived from them.

In this work, we frame this challenge as a problem of feature acquisition of confounding features for causal inference. Our goal is to prioritize acquiring values for a fixed and known subset of missing confounders in samples that lead to efficient average treatment effect estimation. We propose two acquisition strategies based on i) covariate balancing (CB), and ii) reducing statistical estimation error on observed factual outcome error (OE).

Microscopy images provide a standardized way to measure the generalization capacity of image classifiers, as we can image the same classes of objects under increasingly divergent, but controlled factors of variation. We created a public dataset of 132,209 images of mouse cells, COOS-7 (Cells Out Of Sample 7-Class). COOS-7 provides a classification setting where four test datasets have increasing degrees of covariate shift: some images are random subsets of the training data, while others are from experiments reproduced months later and imaged by different instruments. We benchmarked a range of classification models using different representations, including transferred neural network features, end-to-end classification with a supervised deep CNN, and features from a self-supervised CNN. While most classifiers perform well on test datasets similar to the training dataset, all classifiers failed to generalize their performance to datasets with greater covariate shifts. These baselines highlight the challenges of covariate shifts in image data, and establish metrics for improving the generalization capacity of image classifiers.\\n        ',\n",

A number of prior works have focused on this problem, employing advanced methods from computer vision and natural language generation to produce readable reports. However, these works often fail to account for the particular nuances of the radiology domain, and, in particular, the critical importance of clinical accuracy in the resulting generated reports. In this work, we present a domain-aware automatic chest X-ray radiology report generation system which first predicts what topics will be discussed in the report, then conditionally generates sentences corresponding to these topics. The resulting system is fine-tuned using reinforcement learning, considering both readability and clinical accuracy, as assessed by the proposed Clinically Coherent Reward.

In many cases, the morphology of the imaged object exhibits continuous change as it deviates from normality, and thus a generative model can be trained to model this morphological continuum. Moreover, given side information that correlates to certain trend in morphological change, a latent variable model can be regularized such that its latent representation reflects this side information. In this work, we use the Wasserstein Auto-encoder to model this pathology continuum, and apply the Hilbert-Schmitt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to enforce dependency between certain latent features and the provided side information. We experimentally show that the model can provide disentangled and interpretable latent representations and also generate a continuum of morphological changes that corresponds to change in the side information.\\n        ',\n",

In this work, we establish the magnitude of this problem on MIMIC, a public hospital dataset, and showcase a simple solution. We augment MIMIC with the year in which care was provided and show that a model trained using standard feature representations will significantly degrade in quality over time. We find a deterioration of 0.3 AUC when evaluating mortality prediction on data from 10 years later. We find a similar deterioration of 0.15 AUC for length-of-stay.

We hypothesize that one underlying cause of this disparity is due to mistrust between patient and caregivers, and we develop multiple possible trust metric proxies (using coded interpersonal variables and clinical notes) to measure this phenomenon more directly. These metrics show even stronger disparities in end-of-life care than race does, and they also tend to demonstrate statistically significant higher levels of mistrust for black patients than white ones.

We achieve this goal by utilizing mutual information estimators that are based on neural networks, in order to measure two performance metrics, privacy and utility. Using these together in a Lagrangian optimization, we train a separate neural network as a lossy encoder.

At the core of our approach is a new concept that decentralizes the DNN for delocalized, optically accelerated matrix algebra on edge devices. Using a silicon photonic smart transceiver, we demonstrate experimentally that this scheme, termed Netcast, dramatically reduces energy consumption. We demonstrate operation in a photon-starved environment with 40 aJ/multiply of optical energy for 98.8% accurate image recognition and <1 photon/multiply using single photon detectors. Furthermore, we show realistic deployment of our system, classifying images with 3 THz of bandwidth over 86 km of deployed optical fiber in a Boston-area fiber network.

We propose NeuraCrypt, a private encoding scheme based on random deep neural networks. NeuraCrypt encodes raw patient data using a randomly constructed neural network known only to the data-owner, and publishes both the encoded data and associated labels publicly. From a theoretical perspective, we demonstrate that sampling from a sufficiently rich family of encoding functions offers a well-defined and meaningful notion of privacy against a computationally unbounded adversary with full knowledge of the underlying data-distribution. We propose to approximate this family of encoding functions through random deep neural networks. Empirically, we demonstrate the robustness of our encoding to a suite of adversarial attacks and show that NeuraCrypt achieves competitive accuracy to non-private baselines on a variety of x-ray tasks.

While cost-effective most of the time, this sharing can cause undesired interference among seemingly independent traffic. As a result, low-priority traffic can cause increased packet loss to high-priority traffic. Similarly, long flows can prevent the buffer from absorbing incoming bursts even if they do not share the same queue. The cause of this perhaps unintuitive outcome is that today's buffer sharing techniques are unable to guarantee isolation across (priority) queues without statically allocating buffer space. To address this issue, we designed FB, a novel buffer sharing scheme that offers strict isolation guarantees to high-priority traffic without sacrificing link utilizations. Thus, FB outperforms conventional buffer sharing algorithms in absorbing bursts while achieving on-par throughput. We show that FB is practical and runs at line-rate on existing hardware (Barefoot Tofino). Significantly, FB's operations can be approximated in non-programmable devices.\\n        \",\n",

The result is a model that is a fraction of the size of the original with comparable predictive performance (test accuracy). Here, we reassess and evaluate whether the use of test accuracy alone in the terminating condition is sufficient to ensure that the resulting model performs well across a wide spectrum of \"harder\" metrics such as generalization to out-of-distribution data and resilience to noise. Across evaluations on varying architectures and data sets, we find that pruned networks effectively approximate the unpruned model, however, the prune ratio at which pruned networks achieve commensurate performance varies significantly across tasks.

We find that high scoring convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on popular benchmarks exhibit troubling pathologies that allow them to display high accuracy even in the absence of semantically salient features. When a model provides a high-confidence decision without salient supporting input features, we say the classifier has overinterpreted its input, finding too much class-evidence in patterns that appear nonsensical to humans. Here, we demonstrate that neural networks trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet suffer from overinterpretation, and we find models on CIFAR-10 make confident predictions even when 95% of input images are masked and humans cannot discern salient features in the remaining pixel-subsets. We introduce Batched Gradient SIS, a new method for discovering sufficient input subsets for complex datasets, and use this method to show the sufficiency of border pixels in ImageNet for training and testing. Although these patterns portend potential model fragility in real-world deployment, they are in fact valid statistical patterns of the benchmark that alone suffice to attain high test accuracy. Unlike adversarial examples, overinterpretation relies upon unmodified image pixels. We find ensembling and input dropout can each help mitigate overinterpretation.\\n        ',\n",

When applied to various neural network ensembles, MOD significantly improves predictive performance for out-of-distribution test examples without sacrificing in-distribution performance on 38 Protein-DNA binding regression datasets, 9 UCI datasets, and the IMDB-Wiki image dataset.

While immense progress has been made in accelerating the generation of DRRs through algorithmic refinements and GPU implementations, DRR-based optimization remains slow because most DRR generators do not offer a straightforward way to obtain gradients with respect to the imaging parameters. To make DRRs interoperable with gradient-based optimization and deep learning frameworks, we have reformulated Siddon's method, the most popular ray-tracing algorithm used in DRR generation, as a series of vectorized tensor operations. We implemented this vectorized version of Siddon's method in PyTorch, taking advantage of the library's strong automatic differentiation engine to make this DRR generator fully differentiable with respect to its parameters. Additionally, using GPU-accelerated tensor computation enables our vectorized implementation to achieve rendering speeds equivalent to state-of-the-art DRR generators implemented in CUDA and C++. We illustrate the resulting method in the context of slice-to-volume registration. Moreover, our simulations suggest that the loss landscapes for the slice-to-volume registration problem are convex in the neighborhood of the optimal solution, and gradient-based registration promises a much faster solution than prevailing gradient-free optimization strategies.

We accompany our method with theoretical discussion describing the consequences of this symmetry assumption, leading us to select a symmetrized ARAP energy that favors isometric correspondences. Our final formulation optimizes for near-isometry while matching the boundary. We demonstrate our method on a diverse geometric dataset, producing low-distortion matchings that align closely to the boundary.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Despite the superior performance of Deep Learning (DL) on numerous segmentation tasks, the DL-based approaches are notoriously overconfident about their prediction with highly polarized label probability. This is often not desirable for many applications with the inherent label ambiguity even in human annotations. This challenge has been addressed by leveraging multiple annotations per image and the segmentation uncertainty. However, multiple per-image annotations are often not available in a real-world application and the uncertainty does not provide full control on segmentation results to users. In this paper, we propose novel methods to improve the segmentation probability estimation without sacrificing performance in a real-world scenario that we have only one ambiguous annotation per image. We marginalize the estimated segmentation probability maps of networks that are encouraged to under-/over-segment with the varying Tversky loss without penalizing balanced segmentation. Moreover, we propose a unified hypernetwork ensemble method to alleviate the computational burden of training multiple networks. Our approaches successfully estimated the segmentation probability maps that reflected the underlying structures and provided the intuitive control on segmentation for the challenging 3D medical image segmentation. Although the main focus of our proposed methods is not to improve the binary segmentation performance, our approaches marginally outperformed the state-of-the-arts.

MRI shows potential as a research tool as it provides signals directly related to placental function. However, due to the curved and highly variable in vivo shape of the placenta, interpreting and visualizing these images is difficult. We address interpretation challenges by mapping the placenta so that it resembles the familiar ex vivo shape. We formulate the parameterization as an optimization problem for mapping the placental shape represented by a volumetric mesh to a flattened template. We employ the symmetric Dirichlet energy to control local distortion throughout the volume. Local injectivity in the mapping is enforced by a constrained line search during the gradient descent optimization. We validate our method using a research study of 111 placental shapes extracted from BOLD MRI images. Our mapping achieves sub-voxel accuracy in matching the template while maintaining low distortion throughout the volume. We demonstrate how the resulting flattening of the placenta improves visualization of anatomy and function.

However, current GAN technologies for 3D medical image synthesis need to be significantly improved to be readily adapted to real-world medical problems. In this paper, we extend the state-of-the-art StyleGAN2 model, which natively works with two-dimensional images, to enable 3D image synthesis. In addition to the image synthesis, we investigate the controllability and interpretability of the 3D-StyleGAN via style vectors inherited form the original StyleGAN2 that are highly suitable for medical applications: (i) the latent space projection and reconstruction of unseen real images, and (ii) style mixing. We demonstrate the 3D-StyleGAN's performance and feasibility with ~12,000 three-dimensional full brain MR T1 images, although it can be applied to any 3D volumetric images.

Therefore, dynamic fetal MRI, which aims at capturing fetal motion and dynamics of fetal function, is limited to fast imaging techniques with compromises in image quality and resolution. Super-resolution for dynamic fetal MRI is still a challenge, especially when multi-oriented stacks of image slices for oversampling are not available and high temporal resolution for recording the dynamics of the fetus or placenta is desired. Further, fetal motion makes it difficult to acquire high-resolution images for supervised learning methods. To address this problem, in this work, we propose STRESS (Spatio-Temporal Resolution Enhancement with Simulated Scans), a self-supervised super-resolution framework for dynamic fetal MRI with interleaved slice acquisitions. Our proposed method simulates an interleaved slice acquisition along the high-resolution axis on the originally acquired data to generate pairs of low- and high-resolution images. Then, it trains a super-resolution network by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations in the MR time series, which is used to enhance the resolution of the original data. Evaluations on both simulated and in utero data show that our proposed method outperforms other self-supervised super-resolution methods and improves image quality, which is beneficial to other downstream tasks and evaluations.\\n        ',\n",

We load meshes for each mouse brain region, based on the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, into Blender, a powerful 3D computer graphics engine. We then use Blender to color each region and generate images of subcortical, outer-cortical, inner-cortical, top and bottom view renders. In addition to those views, we add new render angles and separate visualization settings for the left and right hemispheres. While BrainPainter traditionally ran from the browser ( https://brainpainter.csail.mit.edu ), we also created a graphical user interface that launches image-generation requests in a user-friendly way, by connecting to the Blender backend via a Docker API. We illustrate a use case of BrainPainter for modeling the progression of tau protein accumulation in a mouse study. Our contributions can help neuroscientists visualize brains in mouse studies and show disease progression.

The transformation is then derived in closed form from the outputs of the filters. This method is useful for applications requiring low latency, such as real-time tracking.

If a real label value is highly informative about the source domain, it cannot be accurately predicted by an invariant predictor. These results are simple and intuitive, but we believe that it is beneficial to state them for medical imaging harmonization.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Most existing algorithms for automatic 3D morphometry of human brain MRI scans are designed for data with near-isotropic voxels at approximately 1 mm resolution, and frequently have contrast constraints as well - typically requiring T1 scans (e.g., MP-RAGE). This limitation prevents the analysis of millions of MRI scans acquired with large inter-slice spacing (\"thick slice\") in clinical settings every year. The inability to quantitatively analyze these scans hinders the adoption of quantitative neuroimaging in healthcare, and precludes research studies that could attain huge sample sizes and hence greatly improve our understanding of the human brain. Recent advances in CNNs are producing outstanding results in super-resolution and contrast synthesis of MRI. However, these approaches are very sensitive to the contrast, resolution and orientation of the input images, and thus do not generalize to diverse clinical acquisition protocols - even within sites. Here we present SynthSR, a method to train a CNN that receives one or more thick-slice scans with different contrast, resolution and orientation, and produces an isotropic scan of canonical contrast (typically a 1 mm MP-RAGE). The presented method does not require any preprocessing, e.g., skull stripping or bias field correction. Crucially, SynthSR trains on synthetic input images generated from 3D segmentations, and can thus be used to train CNNs for any combination of contrasts, resolutions and orientations without high-resolution training data. We test the images generated with SynthSR in an array of common downstream analyses, and show that they can be reliably used for subcortical segmentation and volumetry, image registration (e.g., for tensor-based morphometry), and, if some image quality requirements are met, even cortical thickness morphometry.

In this work, we leverage state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models (here StyleGAN2) for building powerful image priors, which enable application of Bayes' theorem for many downstream reconstruction tasks. Our method, Bayesian Reconstruction through Generative Models (BRGM), uses a single pre-trained generator model to solve different image restoration tasks, i.e., super-resolution and in-painting, by combining it with different forward corruption models. We keep the weights of the generator model fixed, and reconstruct the image by estimating the Bayesian maximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimate over the input latent vector that generated the reconstructed image. We further use variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution over the latent vectors, from which we sample multiple solutions. We demonstrate BRGM on three large and diverse datasets: (i) 60,000 images from the Flick Faces High Quality dataset (ii) 240,000 chest X-rays from MIMIC III and (iii) a combined collection of 5 brain MRI datasets with 7,329 scans.

We introduce a new approach, Parameter Ensembling by Perturbation (PEP), that constructs an ensemble of parameter values as random perturbations of the optimal parameter set from training by a Gaussian with a single variance parameter. The variance is chosen to maximize the log-likelihood of the ensemble average ($\\\\mathbb{L}$) on the validation data set. Empirically, and perhaps surprisingly, $\\\\mathbb{L}$ has a well-defined maximum as the variance grows from zero (which corresponds to the baseline model). Conveniently, calibration level of predictions also tends to grow favorably until the peak of $\\\\mathbb{L}$ is reached. In most experiments, PEP provides a small improvement in performance, and, in some cases, a substantial improvement in empirical calibration. We show that this \"PEP effect\" (the gain in log-likelihood) is related to the mean curvature of the likelihood function and the empirical Fisher information. Experiments on ImageNet pre-trained networks including ResNet, DenseNet, and Inception showed improved calibration and likelihood. We further observed a mild improvement in classification accuracy on these networks. Experiments on classification benchmarks such as MNIST and CIFAR-10 showed improved calibration and likelihood, as well as the relationship between the PEP effect and overfitting; this demonstrates that PEP can be used to probe the level of overfitting that occurred during training. In general, no special training procedure or network architecture is needed, and in the case of pre-trained networks, no additional training is needed.\\n        ',\n",

Recent progress has leveraged neural networks to optimize variational lower bounds on mutual information. Although showing promise for this difficult problem, the variational methods have been theoretically and empirically proven to have serious statistical limitations: 1) many methods struggle to produce accurate estimates when the underlying mutual information is either low or high; 2) the resulting estimators may suffer from high variance. Our approach is based on training a classifier that provides the probability that a data sample pair is drawn from the joint distribution rather than from the product of its marginal distributions. Moreover, we establish a direct connection between mutual information and the average log odds estimate produced by the classifier on a test set, leading to a simple and accurate estimator of mutual information. We show theoretically that our method and other variational approaches are equivalent when they achieve their optimum, while our method sidesteps the variational bound.

This dataset was split into patients with and without congestive heart failure (CHF). Pulmonary edema severity labels from the associated radiology reports were extracted from patients with CHF as four different ordinal levels: 0, no edema; 1, vascular congestion; 2, interstitial edema; and 3, alveolar edema.

Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed on both models.\\n  Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for differentiating alveolar edema from no edema was 0.99 for the semi-supervised model and 0.87 for the pre-trained models. Performance of the algorithm was inversely related to the difficulty in categorizing milder states of pulmonary edema (shown as AUCs for semi-supervised model and pre-trained model, respectively): 2 versus 0, 0.88 and 0.81; 1 versus 0, 0.79 and 0.66; 3 versus 1, 0.93 and 0.82; 2 versus 1, 0.69 and 0.73; and, 3 versus 2, 0.88 and 0.63.\\n  Conclusion: Deep learning models were trained on a large chest radiograph dataset and could grade the severity of pulmonary edema on chest radiographs with high performance.\\n        ',\n",

Current mitigation of motion artifacts is predominantly performed by fast, single-shot MRI and retrospective motion correction. Estimation of fetal pose in real time during MRI stands to benefit prospective methods to detect and mitigate fetal motion artifacts where inferred fetal motion is combined with online slice prescription with low-latency decision making. Current developments of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), offer a novel approach for fetal landmarks detection. In this task 15 agents are deployed to detect 15 landmarks simultaneously by DRL. The optimization is challenging, and here we propose an improved DRL that incorporates priors on physical structure of the fetal body. First, we use graph communication layers to improve the communication among agents based on a graph where each node represents a fetal-body landmark. Further, additional reward based on the distance between agents and physical structures such as the fetal limbs is used to fully exploit physical structure. Evaluation of this method on a repository of 3-mm resolution in vivo data demonstrates a mean accuracy of landmark estimation within 10 mm of ground truth as 87.3%, and a mean error of 6.9 mm.

The proposed joint learning schemes enable both correction of artifacts native to the frequency space and manipulation of image space representations to reconstruct coherent image structures at every layer of the network. This is in contrast to most current deep learning approaches for image reconstruction that treat frequency and image space features separately and often operate exclusively in one of the two spaces. We demonstrate the advantages of joint convolutional learning for a variety of tasks, including motion correction, denoising, reconstruction from undersampled acquisitions, and combined undersampling and motion correction on simulated and real world multicoil MRI data. The joint models produce consistently high quality output images across all tasks and datasets. When integrated into a state of the art unrolled optimization network with physics-inspired data consistency constraints for undersampled reconstruction, the proposed architectures significantly improve the optimization landscape, which yields an order of magnitude reduction of training time.

The methods used by challenge participants included multivariate linear regression, machine learning methods such as support vector machines and deep neural networks, as well as disease progression models. No single submission was best at predicting all three outcomes. For clinical diagnosis and ventricle volume prediction, the best algorithms strongly outperform simple baselines in predictive ability.

To develop a deep learning-based segmentation model for a new image dataset (e.g., of different contrast), one usually needs to create a new labeled training dataset, which can be prohibitively expensive, or rely on suboptimal ad hoc adaptation or augmentation approaches. In this paper, we propose an alternative strategy that combines a conventional probabilistic atlas-based segmentation with deep learning, enabling one to train a segmentation model for new MRI scans without the need for any manually segmented images. Our experiments include thousands of brain MRI scans and demonstrate that the proposed method achieves good accuracy for a brain MRI segmentation task for different MRI contrasts, requiring only approximately 15 seconds at test time on a GPU.

Monitoring placental function in vivo promises to support pregnancy assessment and to improve care outcomes. We aim to alleviate visualization and interpretation challenges presented by the shape of the placenta when it is attached to the curved uterine wall. To do so, we flatten the volumetric mesh that captures placental shape to resemble the well-studied ex vivo shape. We formulate our method as a map from the in vivo shape to a flattened template that minimizes the symmetric Dirichlet energy to control distortion throughout the volume. Local injectivity is enforced via constrained line search during gradient descent. We evaluate the proposed method on 28 placenta shapes extracted from MRI images in a clinical study of placental function. We achieve sub-voxel accuracy in mapping the boundary of the placenta to the template while successfully controlling distortion throughout the volume. We illustrate how the resulting mapping of the placenta enhances visualization of placental anatomy and function.

However, some brain structures (e.g., globus pallidus, thalamus and its nuclei) can be extracted more accurately by fusing the two modalities. Following the framework of Bayesian segmentation with probabilistic atlases and unsupervised appearance modeling, we present here a novel algorithm to jointly segment multi-modal sMRI/dMRI data. We propose a hierarchical likelihood term for the dMRI defined on the unit ball, which combines the Beta and Dimroth-Scheidegger-Watson distributions to model the data at each voxel. This term is integrated with a mixture of Gaussians for the sMRI data, such that the resulting joint unsupervised likelihood enables the analysis of multi-modal scans acquired with any type of MRI contrast, b-values, or number of directions, which enables wide applicability. We also propose an inference algorithm to estimate the maximum-a-posteriori model parameters from input images, and to compute the most likely segmentation. Using a recently published atlas derived from histology, we apply our method to thalamic nuclei segmentation on two datasets: HCP (state of the art) and ADNI (legacy) - producing lower sample sizes than Bayesian segmentation with sMRI alone.\\n        ',\n",

Time-course analysis for in-utero volumetric MRI time series often suffers from substantial and unpredictable fetal motion. Registration provides voxel correspondences between images and is commonly employed for motion correction. Current registration methods often fail when aligning images that are substantially different from a template (reference image). To achieve accurate and robust alignment, we make a Markov assumption on the nature of motion and take advantage of the temporal smoothness in the image data. Forward message passing in the corresponding hidden Markov model (HMM) yields an estimation algorithm that only has to account for relatively small motion between consecutive frames. We evaluate the utility of the temporal model in the context of in-utero MRI time series alignment by examining the accuracy of propagated segmentation label maps. Our results suggest that the proposed model captures accurately the temporal dynamics of transformations in in-utero MRI time series.\\n        ',\n",

Accurate assessment of pulmonary edema in heart failure is critical when making treatment and disposition decisions. Our work is grounded in a large-scale clinical dataset of over 300,000 x-ray images with associated radiology reports. While edema severity labels can be extracted unambiguously from a small fraction of the radiology reports, accurate annotation is challenging in most cases. To take advantage of the unlabeled images, we develop a Bayesian model that includes a variational auto-encoder for learning a latent representation from the entire image set trained jointly with a regressor that employs this representation for predicting pulmonary edema severity. Our experimental results suggest that modeling the distribution of images jointly with the limited labels improves the accuracy of pulmonary edema scoring compared to a strictly supervised approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to employ machine learning algorithms to automatically and quantitatively assess the severity of pulmonary edema in chest x-ray images.\\n        ',\n",

DKT infers robust multimodal biomarker trajectories in rare neurodegenerative diseases even when only limited, unimodal data is available, by transferring information from larger multimodal datasets from common neurodegenerative diseases. DKT is a joint-disease generative model of biomarker progressions, which exploits biomarker relationships that are shared across diseases. Our proposed method allows, for the first time, the estimation of plausible, multimodal biomarker trajectories in Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), a rare neurodegenerative disease where only unimodal MRI data is available. For this we train DKT on a combined dataset containing subjects with two distinct diseases and sizes of data available: 1) a larger, multimodal typical AD (tAD) dataset from the TADPOLE Challenge, and 2) a smaller unimodal Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) dataset from the Dementia Research Centre (DRC), for which only a limited number of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans are available. Although validation is challenging due to lack of data in PCA, we validate DKT on synthetic data and two patient datasets (TADPOLE and PCA cohorts), showing it can estimate the ground truth parameters in the simulation and predict unseen biomarkers on the two patient datasets. While we demonstrated DKT on Alzheimer's variants, we note DKT is generalisable to other forms of related neurodegenerative diseases.

We learn model parameters by optimizing the interme- diate steps of the evolution in addition to the final segmentation. To this end, we train our segmentation propagation model by presenting incom- plete and/or inaccurate input segmentations paired with a recommended next step.

We demonstrate the advantages of this approach on a dataset of 20 images from CHD patients, learning a model that accurately segments individual heart chambers and great vessels.

Although large data sets of clinical images contain a wealth of information, time constraints during acquisition result in sparse scans that fail to capture much of the anatomy. These characteristics often render computational analysis impractical as many image analysis algorithms tend to fail when applied to such images. Highly specialized algorithms that explicitly handle sparse slice spacing do not generalize well across problem domains. In contrast, we aim to enable application of existing algorithms that were originally developed for high resolution research scans to significantly undersampled scans. We introduce a generative model that captures fine-scale anatomical structure across subjects in clinical image collections and derive an algorithm for filling in the missing data in scans with large inter-slice spacing.

The keypoint transfer algorithm includes three steps: (i) keypoint matching, (ii) voting-based keypoint labeling, and (iii) keypoint-based probabilistic transfer of organ segmentations. We report segmentation results for abdominal organs in whole-body CT and MRI, as well as in contrast-enhanced CT and MRI. Our method offers a speed-up of about three orders of magnitude in comparison to common multi-atlas segmentation, while achieving an accuracy that compares favorably. Moreover, keypoint transfer does not require the registration to an atlas or a training phase. Finally, the method allows for the segmentation of scans with highly variable field-of-view.\\n        ',\n",

Developing such a registration method is very challenging, due to factors such as missing correspondence in images, the complexity of brain pathology and the demand for fast computation. We propose a novel feature-driven active framework. Here, landmarks and their displacement are first estimated from a pair of US images using corresponding local image features. Subsequently, a Gaussian Process (GP) model is used to interpolate a dense deformation field from the sparse landmarks. Kernels of the GP are estimated by using variograms and a discrete grid search method. If necessary, the user can actively add new landmarks based on the image context and visualization of the uncertainty measure provided by the GP to further improve the result.

Our analysis relies on a new local property for how similar nearby patches are, and fuses existing lines of work on modeling natural imagery patches and theory for nonparametric classification. We use the model to derive a new patch-based segmentation algorithm that iterates between inferring local label patches and merging these local segmentations to produce a globally consistent image segmentation.

A common strategy to overcome this problem is to perform dimensionality reduction on selected landmarks and to successively embed the entire dataset with the Nystr√∂m method. The two main challenges that arise are: (i) the landmarks selected in non-Euclidean geometries must result in a low reconstruction error, (ii) the graph constructed from sparsely sampled landmarks must approximate the manifold well. We propose the sampling of landmarks from determinantal distributions on non-Euclidean spaces. Since current determinantal sampling algorithms have the same complexity as those for manifold learning, we present an efficient approximation running in linear time. Further, we recover the local geometry after the sparsification by assigning each landmark a local covariance matrix, estimated from the original point set. The resulting neighborhood selection based on the Bhattacharyya distance improves the embedding of sparsely sampled manifolds. Our experiments show a significant performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art landmark selection techniques.\\n        ',\n",

We subsequently show how this variational DPP approximation generalizes and extends mean-field approximation, and can be learned efficiently by exploiting the fast sampling properties of DPPs. Our motivating application comes from bioinformatics, where we aim to identify a diverse set of genes whose expression profiles predict a tumor type where the diversity is defined with respect to a gene-gene interaction network. We also explore an application in spatial statistics. In both cases, we demonstrate that the proposed method yields significantly more diverse feature sets than classic sparse methods, without compromising accuracy.\\n        ',\n",

To change the garment and model size while maintaining a photorealistic image, we incorporate image alignment ideas from the medical imaging literature into the StyleGAN2-ADA architecture. Our method learns deformation fields at multiple resolutions and uses a spatial transformer to modify the garment and model size. We evaluate our approach along three dimensions: realism, garment faithfulness, and size. To our knowledge, SizeGAN is the first method to focus on this size under-representation problem for modeling clothing. We provide an analysis comparing SizeGAN to other plausible approaches and additionally provide the first clothing dataset with size labels. In a user study comparing SizeGAN and two recent virtual try-on methods, we show that our method ranks first in each dimension, and was vastly preferred for realism and garment faithfulness. In comparison to most previous work, which has focused on generating photorealistic images of garments, our work shows that it is possible to generate images that are both photorealistic and cover diverse garment sizes.\\n        ',\n",

We outline an efficient learning algorithm to do so that leverages recent work in nested optimization and implicit differentiation. In experiments, considering three datasets and eight predictive tasks, we find that TaskAug is competitive with or improves on prior work, and the learned policies shed light on what transformations are most effective for different tasks.

       " '\\n        We introduce HyperMorph, a framework that facilitates efficient hyperparameter tuning in learning-based deformable image registration. Classical registration algorithms perform an iterative pair-wise optimization to compute a deformation field that aligns two images. Recent learning-based approaches leverage large image datasets to learn a function that rapidly estimates a deformation for a given image pair. In both strategies, the accuracy of the resulting spatial correspondences is strongly influenced by the choice of certain hyperparameter values. However, an effective hyperparameter search consumes substantial time and human effort as it often involves training multiple models for different fixed hyperparameter values and may lead to suboptimal registration. We propose an amortized hyperparameter learning strategy to alleviate this burden by learning the impact of hyperparameters on deformation fields. We design a meta network, or hypernetwork, that predicts the parameters of a registration network for input hyperparameters, thereby comprising a single model that generates the optimal deformation field corresponding to given hyperparameter values. This strategy enables fast, high-resolution hyperparameter search at test-time, reducing the inefficiency of traditional approaches while increasing flexibility. We also demonstrate additional benefits of HyperMorph, including enhanced robustness to model initialization and the ability to rapidly identify optimal hyperparameter values specific to a dataset, image contrast, task, or even anatomical region, all without the need to retrain models.

Classical registration methods solve an optimization problem to find a set of spatial correspondences between two images, while learning-based methods leverage a training dataset to learn a function that generates these correspondences. The quality of the results for both types of techniques depends greatly on the choice of hyperparameters. Unfortunately, hyperparameter tuning is time-consuming and typically involves training many separate models with various hyperparameter values, potentially leading to suboptimal results. To address this inefficiency, we introduce amortized hyperparameter learning for image registration, a novel strategy to learn the effects of hyperparameters on deformation fields. The proposed framework learns a hypernetwork that takes in an input hyperparameter and modulates a registration network to produce the optimal deformation field for that hyperparameter value. In effect, this strategy trains a single, rich model that enables rapid, fine-grained discovery of hyperparameter values from a continuous interval at test-time. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to optimize multiple hyperparameters considerably faster than existing search strategies, leading to a reduced computational and human burden as well as increased flexibility.

We focus on estimating a patient's risk of cardiovascular death after an acute coronary syndrome based on a patient's raw electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Learning from this signal is challenging for two reasons: 1) positive examples signifying a downstream cardiovascular event are scarce, causing drastic class imbalance, and 2) each patient's ECG signal consists of thousands of heartbeats, accompanied by a single label for the downstream outcome. Machine learning has been previously applied to this task, but most approaches rely on hand-crafted features and domain knowledge. We propose a method that learns a representation from the raw ECG signal by using a multiple instance learning framework. We present a learned risk score for cardiovascular death that outperforms existing risk metrics in predicting cardiovascular death within 30, 60, 90, and 365 days on a dataset of 5000 patients.\\n        \",\n",
       " \"\\n        We present VoxelMorph, a fast learning-based framework for deformable, pairwise medical image registration. Traditional registration methods optimize an objective function for each pair of images, which can be time-consuming for large datasets or rich deformation models. In contrast to this approach, and building on recent learning-based methods, we formulate registration as a function that maps an input image pair to a deformation field that aligns these images. We parameterize the function via a convolutional neural network (CNN), and optimize the parameters of the neural network on a set of images. Given a new pair of scans, VoxelMorph rapidly computes a deformation field by directly evaluating the function. In this work, we explore two different training strategies. In the first (unsupervised) setting, we train the model to maximize standard image matching objective functions that are based on the image intensities. In the second setting, we leverage auxiliary segmentations available in the training data. We demonstrate that the unsupervised model's accuracy is comparable to state-of-the-art methods, while operating orders of magnitude faster. We also show that VoxelMorph trained with auxiliary data improves registration accuracy at test time, and evaluate the effect of training set size on registration. Our method promises to speed up medical image analysis and processing pipelines, while facilitating novel directions in learning-based registration and its applications.

       " \"\\n        Thanks to the rapid proliferation of connected devices, sensor-generated time series constitute a large and growing portion of the world's data. Often, this data is collected from distributed, resource-constrained devices and centralized at one or more servers. A key challenge in this setup is reducing the size of the transmitted data without sacrificing its quality. Lower quality reduces the data's utility, but smaller size enables both reduced network and storage costs at the servers and reduced power consumption in sensing devices. A natural solution is to compress the data at the sensing devices. Unfortunately, existing compression algorithms either violate the memory and latency constraints common for these devices or, as we show experimentally, perform poorly on sensor-generated time series.\\n  We introduce a time series compression algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios while requiring less than 1KB of memory and adding virtually no latency. This method is suitable not only for low-power devices collecting data, but also for servers storing and querying data; in the latter context, it can decompress at over 3GB/s in a single thread, even faster than many algorithms with much lower compression ratios. A key component of our method is a high-speed forecasting algorithm that can be trained online and significantly outperforms alternatives such as delta coding.\\n  Extensive experiments on datasets from many domains show that these results hold not only for sensor data but also across a wide array of other time series.\\n        \",\n",
       " '\\n        Machine learning approaches have been effective in predicting adverse outcomes in different clinical settings. These models are often developed and evaluated on datasets with heterogeneous patient populations. However, good predictive performance on the aggregate population does not imply good performance for specific groups.\\n  In this work, we present a two-step framework to 1) learn relevant patient subgroups, and 2) predict an outcome for separate patient populations in a multi-task framework, where each population is a separate task. We demonstrate how to discover relevant groups in an unsupervised way with a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder. We show that using these groups in a multi-task framework leads to better predictive performance of in-hospital mortality both across groups and overall. We also highlight the need for more granular evaluation of performance when dealing with heterogeneous populations.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        Traditional deformable registration techniques achieve impressive results and offer a rigorous theoretical treatment, but are computationally intensive since they solve an optimization problem for each image pair. Recently, learning-based methods have facilitated fast registration by learning spatial deformation functions. However, these approaches use restricted deformation models, require supervised labels, or do not guarantee a diffeomorphic (topology-preserving) registration. Furthermore, learning-based registration tools have not been derived from a probabilistic framework that can offer uncertainty estimates. In this paper, we present a probabilistic generative model and derive an unsupervised learning-based inference algorithm that makes use of recent developments in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We demonstrate our method on a 3D brain registration task, and provide an empirical analysis of the algorithm. Our approach results in state of the art accuracy and very fast runtimes, while providing diffeomorphic guarantees and uncertainty estimates. Our implementation is available online at http://voxelmorph.csail.mit.edu .\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        We address the computational problem of novel human pose synthesis. Given an image of a person and a desired pose, we produce a depiction of that person in that pose, retaining the appearance of both the person and background. We present a modular generative neural network that synthesizes unseen poses using training pairs of images and poses taken from human action videos. Our network separates a scene into different body part and background layers, moves body parts to new locations and refines their appearances, and composites the new foreground with a hole-filled background. These subtasks, implemented with separate modules, are trained jointly using only a single target image as a supervised label. We use an adversarial discriminator to force our network to synthesize realistic details conditioned on pose. We demonstrate image synthesis results on three action classes: golf, yoga/workouts and tennis, and show that our method produces accurate results within action classes as well as across action classes. Given a sequence of desired poses, we also produce coherent videos of actions.\\n        ',\n",
       " '\\n        We present a fast learning-based algorithm for deformable, pairwise 3D medical image registration. Current registration methods optimize an objective function independently for each pair of images, which can be time-consuming for large data. We define registration as a parametric function, and optimize its parameters given a set of images from a collection of interest. Given a new pair of scans, we can quickly compute a registration field by directly evaluating the function using the learned parameters. We model this function using a convolutional neural network (CNN), and use a spatial transform layer to reconstruct one image from another while imposing smoothness constraints on the registration field. The proposed method does not require supervised information such as ground truth registration fields or anatomical landmarks. We demonstrate registration accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art 3D image registration, while operating orders of magnitude faster in practice.
